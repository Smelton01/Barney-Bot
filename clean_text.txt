“the Year 2030” The story of how I met your mother. Are we being punished for something? No. Yeah, is this going to take a while? Yes.  Twenty-five years ago, before I was dad, I had this whole other life. living in New York with Marshall, my best friend from college. My life was good, and then Uncle Marshall went and screwed the whole thing up. Will you marry me? Yes, perfect!  And then you’re engaged, you pop the champagne, you drink a toast, you have sex on the kitchen floor - Don’t have sex on our kitchen floor. Got it.  Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted. The night you met, your first date, other first things…. Ha ha, yeah, sorry.  We thought you were asleep. It’s physics, Marshall, if the bottom bunk moves, the top bunk moves too.   My god, you’re getting engaged tonight. Yeah, what are you doing tonight? What was I doing?  Here, Uncle Marshall was taking the biggest step of his life, and me?  I’m calling up your Uncle Barney. Lebanese girls.  Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians. Hey, d’you want to do something tonight? Ok, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes, and suit up! Hey. Where’s your suit?  Just once when I say “suit up,” I wish you’d put on a suit. I did, that one time. It was a blazer! You know, ever since college, it’s been Marshall, and Lily, and me.  Now it’s going to be Marshall and Lily, and me.  They’ll get married, start a family,  before long, I’m that weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call “Uncle Ted”. I see what this is about.  Have you forgotten what I said to you the night we met? Ted, I’m going to teach you how to live.  Barney, we met at the urinal. Oh, right. Hi. Lose the goatee.  It doesn’t go with your suit. I’m not wearing a suit. Get a suit.  Suits are cool,  Exhibit A. Thirty, right.  You’re right.  I guess it’s just, you’re best friend gets engaged,  you start thinking about that stuff. I thought I was your best friend.  Ted, say I’m your best friend. You’re my best friend, Barney. Good, then as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game I like to call “Have you met Ted?” Wait, no.  No, no, no.  We’re not playing “Have You Met Ted.” Hi, have you met Ted? Hi, I’m Ted. Yasmin. It’s a very pretty name. Thanks, it’s Lebanese. Hey! Ugh, I’m exhausted.  It was Finger Painting Day at school, and a five-year-old boy got to second base with me . Yes, I am. Aw,  are you sure that’s a good idea after last time?  You looked really creepy without eyebrows. I can handle this; I think you’ll find I’m full of surprises tonight. So there’s more surprises?  Like what? Marshall was in his second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet. Boogity-boo! And that’s all of ‘em!  I’m going to go, cook. I’m so happy for Marshall, I really am.  I just couldn’t imagine settling down right now. So do you think you’ll ever get married? Well, maybe eventually.  Some fall day, possibly in Central Park, simple ceremony, we’ll write our own vows. Band, no DJ; people will dance, I’m not going to worry about it!  Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged?  Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh? Actually, I think it’s cute. Well, you’re clearly drunk  One more for the lady! Oh, hey, look what I’ve got. Aw, Honey.  Champagne! Yeah. No, you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne. I’m not scared. Then open it. Fine.   Please open it. Gosh, you are unbelievable, Marshall. No, you open it…. There are two big questions a man has to ask in life. One, you plan out for months; the other just slips out when you’re half drunk at some bar. Will you marry me? D’you want to go out sometime? Of course, you idiot! I’m sorry,  Carl’s my boyfriend. What’s up, Carl? I promised Ted we wouldn’t do that. Did you know there’s a Pop-Tart® under your fridge? No, but dibs.  Where’s that champagne?  I want to drink a toast with my fiancée. Aw. I don’t know why I was so scared of this. It’s pretty easy, right? Ah! Oh! Why am I freaking out all of a sudden?  This is crazy; I’m not ready to settle down. How does Carl land a Lebanese girl? The plan has always been “Don’t even think about it until you’re thirty.” Exactly.  The guy doesn’t even own a suit! Plus, Marshall’s found the love of his life.  Even if I was ready, which I’m not, but if I was, it’s like, “Ok, I’m ready! Where is she?” …and there she was. It was like something from an old movie, where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, “See that girl?  I’m going to marry her someday.” Hey Barney, see that girl? Oh yeah, you just know she likes it dirty.  Go say “Hi.” I can’t just go say “Hi.” I need a plan, I’m going to wait until she goes to the bathroom, then I’ll strategically place myself by the jukebox, so that when she comes…. Mmm-hmmm, great one. Hi, have you met Ted? Hi. Let me guess,  Ted. Take us to the hospital. Whoa, whoa, whoa, did you hit her? He? Ha ha. Hit me? Please, this guy could barely even spank me in bed for fun. He’s all like,  “Oh Honey, did that hurt?” And I’m like, “Come on, let me have it you pansy!” No, no, no, no, it’s okay, go on.  So these, uh, spankings, you in pajamas or, uh, “au naturelle?” So, what do you do? I’m a reporter for Metro News 1. Ooh. Well, kind of a reporter.  I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know, like, um, a monkey who can play the ukulele, but I’m hoping to get some bigger stories soon. Bigger, like a gorilla with an upright bass?  Sorry, you’re really pretty.  Ooh, your friends don’t seem too happy. Yeah, see, the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend so tonight, every guy is the “enemy.” You know, if it’ll make your friend feel better, you could throw a drink in my face; I don’t mind. She would love that!  It does look fun in the movies. Hey, you want to have dinner with me Saturday night? Oh, I can’t.  I’m going to Orlando for a week on Friday; some guy’s attempting to make the world’s biggest pancake, guess who’s covering it. That’s going to take a week? Yeah, he’s going to eat it, too; it’s another record. Hey, what’s taking so long? Uh, I know this is a long shot, but how about tomorrow night? Yeah, what the hell? Jerk!  That was fun. De-, wait for it, -nied!  Denied! We’re going out tomorrow night. I thought we were playing laser tag tomorrow night? Yeah, I was never going to go play laser tag. The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn. Wow, that is one bad-ass-blue French horn. Yeah. Mmm-hmmm. Sort of looks like a, Smurf penis. When you go on a first date, you really don’t want to say “Smurf penis,” girls don’t ordinarily like that. But this was no ordinary girl. Lily? How long have you been sitting there?  Stupid eye patch. Mom, Dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.  Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman? Ah, let’s see, she likes dogs? I’ve got five dogs. She drinks Scotch? I love a Scotch that’s old enough to order its own Scotch. Can quote obscure lines from Ghostbusters? Ray, when someone asks you if you’re a god you say “Yes!” And, I’m saving the best for last. Do you want these?  I hate olives. She hates olives, awesome! The Olive Theory. The Olive Theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily.  He hates olives, she loves them.  In a weird way, that’s what makes them such a great couple, a perfect balance. You know, I’ve had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever. I can take them off your hands. They’re all yours. Oh, it is on! It is on  till the break of dawn. But wait, it’s only the break of ten-thirty.  What happened? I’ve got to get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace.  It’s got to be blue, it’s got to be French. No Green Clarinet? Nope. Come on, no purple tuba? It’s a Smurf penis or no dice. There you are!  We’ve got a jumper, some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.  Come on, you’re covering it! Um, alright. I’ll be right there. I’m sorry. I had a really great time tonight. Yeah, well…. So?  Did you kiss her? No, the moment wasn’t right. Look, this woman could actually be my future wife; I want our first kiss to be amazing. Aw, Ted, that is so sweet.  So, you chickened out like a little bitch. What?  I did not chicken out.  You know what?  I don’t need to take first-kiss advice from some pirate who hasn’t been single since the first week of college. Ted, anyone who’s single would tell you the same thing.  Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don’t believe me, call him. Hey loser, how’s not playing laser tag?  Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I killed you Connor.  Don’t make me get your mom! Hey, listen, I need your opinion on something. Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes, and suit up! So, these guys think I chickened out.  What do you think? I can’t believe you’re still not wearing a suit. She didn’t even give me the signal. What is she going to-, is she going to bat her eyes at you in Morse code?  Ted?  Kiss me.  No, you just kiss her! Not if you don’t get the signal. Did Marshall give me the signal? No!  I didn’t, I swear. But see, at least tonight, I get to sleep knowing  Marshall and Me - never going to happen.  You should’ve kissed her. I should’ve kissed her. Well, maybe in a week, when she gets back from Orlando. you will never see that one again. There she is. Ooh, she’s cute!  Hey Carl, turn it up! …persuaded him to reconsider, at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending. Reporting from Metro News 1, back to you, Bill. Huh, the guy didn’t jump. I’m going to go kiss her, right now. that’s freakin’ crazy! I’ve got to take the leap !  Ok, not a perfect metaphor ‘cause for me, it’s fall in love and get married and for him, it’s death. Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.    By the way, did I congratulate you two? I’m doing this. Let’s go. Word up! We’re coming with you. Barney? Alright, but under one condition. Look at you, you beautiful bastard, you suited up!  This is totally going in my blog. Stop the car!  Pu-, uh, pull over right here.  I’ve got to do something. Excuse me, pardon me, just a second. Enjoy your coffee. Hey, hey! Go, go, go! Everybody brings flowers. Whew, ok, moment of truth.  Wish me luck. Ted’s going to get it on with a TV reporter.  Hehe.  . Kiss her, Ted.  Kiss her good. Kiss the crap out of that girl! Marshall, remember this night.  When you’re the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you’re going to tell this story. Why does he get to be the best man?    I’m your best friend! As I walked up to that door, a million thoughts raced through my mind.  Unfortunately, one particular thought did not. I’ve got five dogs. Not good, not good, not good, not good. No! Get back in there! You’re wearing a suit! Ted? Hi! I was just uh - Come on up. He’s in. So, Ranjit, you must’ve done it with a Lebanese girl. Ok, that’s my “Barney-limit.” I’m going to see if that Bodega has a bathroom. Actually, I’m from Bangladesh. Mmm-hmmm. the women hot there? Here’s a picture of my wife! A simple “no” would have sufficed. She’s lovely. So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn at one in the morning, in a suit? I was just hoping to get those olives - that you said I could have. Would you like those olives with some gin and vermouth? Are you trying to get me drunk? For starters. Thank you. So, Marshall. This “Olive Theory,” based on you and Lily? Yeah. You hateolives, Lily loves them.  You can’t stand them. Yeah, ‘hate olives. Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives, you had some.  What up? You have to swear that this does not leave this cab. I swear. I swear. On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives.  I said, “Sure, I hate olives.” But you like olives! Well, I was eighteen, ok? I was a virgin.   been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives. Don’t get married. I think I like your “Olive Theory.” I think I like your new French horn. I think I like your nose. I think I’m in love with you. What? What? What? Come on man, you said your stomach’s been hurting, right?  You know what that is!   hunger.  You’re hungry for experience, hungry for something new, hungry for olives.  But you’re too scared to do anything about it. Yeah, I’m scared, ok?  But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily - committing forever, no other women, it doesn’t scare me at all.  I’m marrying that girl. Lily.  Lily, I like olives. We’ll make it work. Aw. So Orlando, you going to hit Disney World? You love me? Oh God, I, I, I can’t believe I said that.  Why did I say that?  Who says that?  I should just go. Hold on, wait a minute. promised you these. Olives, thanks.  I love you.    What is wrong with me? Why are we still sitting here?  Let’s go, we can still make last call.  What do you say Lil’?    ‘Cause you’re a pirate. Ok, eye patch gone .  We can’t just abandon Ted, if it doesn’t go well up there, he’s going to need some support. It’s been like twenty minutes.  You think they’re doin’ it? You think they’re doing it in front of the dogs? Doggie style. Hey, I knew this girl in college, she had this golden retriever…. Ok, we can go to the bar, just stop talking. Hit it Ranjit! So when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word “psycho?” I prefer “eccentric.” Good night, Psycho. Great, um, how do I get to the F train? Oh, um, two blocks that way and take a right. Great. I’m done being single, I’m not good at it.  Look, obviously you can’t tell a woman you just met you love her, but it sucks that you can’t.  I’ll tell you something though, if a woman, not you, just some hypothetical woman, were to bear with me through all this, I think I’d make a damn good husband, because that’s the stuff I’d be good at.  Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father, and walking her five hypothetical dogs; being a good kisser. Everyone thinks they’re a good kisser. Oh, I’ve got references. Good night, Ted. And I’m a good hand shaker. That’s a pretty great hand shake. And that was it, I’ll probably never see her again. What? That was the signal! That long lingering handshake, you should’ve kissed her! There’s no such thing as “the signal,” but yeah, that was the signal. Signal. Ah, Carl, thank you.  Something I’ve got to do. By the way, you should’ve kissed her. Carl! You guys weren’t there. I am so turned on right now. Guys, trust me, I’ve seen the signal. That was not the signal. Yeah Ted, we’re not on you anymore. To my fiancée. To the future. To one hell of a night! That was not the signal! I asked her about it years later, and yeah, that was the signal.  I could’ve kissed her, but that’s the funny thing about destiny, it happens whether you plan it or not.  I mean, I never thought I’d see that girl again, but it turns out, I was just too close to the puzzle to see the picture that was forming, because that, kids, is the true story, of how I met your Aunt Robin. Aunt Robin? I thought this was about how you met mom. Will you relax?  I’m getting to it. Like I said, it’s a long story. Okay, where was I? You were telling us how you met mom. In excruciating detail… Then I saw… Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That’s where your Uncle Barney came in. I suggest we play a little game I like to call, “Have you Met Ted?” No, no, no—we’re not playing “Have you Met Ted!” So I asked her out, and I know this sounds crazy… but after just one date, I was in love with her, which made me say something stupid I think I’m in love with you. What? Oh, Dad. So then what happened? Nothing. I mean, I made a complete fool of myself. So… a week went by and I decided not to call her. So you’re not goanna call her? You went from, “I think I’m in love with you” to “I’m not gonna call her?” I wasn’t in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.  Robin! Hey! Look who I ran into! Since when do you guys know each other? Uh… since about  Hello, Sailor! They just got engaged. Well, I should get back to the station. See you guys.  Nice seeing you, Ted. Yeah, you too.  Damn it. What? I’m in love with her. No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it’s over—move on. I don’t know! I just have this feeling. She’s the future Mrs. Ted Mosby. Lily, you squeaked? She said something about me didn’t she? Come on, spill it, Red. Fine! So what do we think of Ted? Ted’s something else. Huh… I’m gonna spin that as good. Lots of guys are “something”, I’m “something else”. Comes on a little strong. But…that’s part of my charm. But that’s part of his charm. Oh, totally. I mean, he’s sweet, he’s charming, he’s just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right? Are you kidding? This flapper—for knocks. Oops… She wants casual. Okay, I’ll be casual. I’m gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it’s a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the “happily ever after” thing but you don’t get there unless you play the game. So’re you gonna ask her out? Yeah—No! I can’t ask her out, because if I ask her out I’m asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? Did you guys get high? I got it! I don’t ask her out… I invite her to our party next Friday. We’re having a party next Friday? We are now—Casual Yeah, cuz nothing says “Casual” like inviting a hundred people over just to “Mac” on one girl. Oh, and Lily—that’s my leg. You waited five minutes to tell me that? Alright—so call her up! No—calling’s not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a “chance” encounter. that’s great, Ted. You’ll be the most “Casual” stalker ever. Scene Two Now ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger, Lily had been…well... extra affectionate. Baby, no. I have a twenty-five paged paper on unconstitutional law due on Monday, I barely started, Hey, I’m just sitting here. Wearing my ring… my beautiful ring. Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong. Like my shirt. Kind of don’t wanna wear my shirt anymore. Or… my underwear. Oh—that’s right—I’m not wearing any. No underwear? Not slightly. Guys, boundaries! Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on <a annotation-fragment="6899649" class="referent" classification="verified" data-id="4877407" href="/How-i-met-your-mother-purple-giraffe-annotated#note-6899649" image="false" ng-class="{ 75th in Columbus 75th in Columbus. where four year old, Leroy Ellensburg, climbed inside a grab a prize machine  and gotten stuck. And on the pursuit of a stuffed purple giraffe. We’re clear Ted? Robin, wow! What are the odds? What are you doing here? Oh, you know, just—uh—Shopping for—uh—dip Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine, how sweet of you to call it news. Wow, kid in a crane machine  You just had to have that toy didn’t ya?

Yeah—sorry—cuz I’ve been saying “next Friday” all week, but yeah it’s tonight. The—uh—party’s tonight. But, you know, whatever. Scene Three Hello? No, no I’m just writing my paper. Hitting the books. Scene Four So, Gatsby, what are you gonna do when Robin shows up? Okay, I got it all planned out. She steps through the door, and where’s Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I’m across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, “Hey, what’s up?” She says, “Hey, nice place” etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, “Well make yourself at home,” and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, “Oh, you’re still here?” I say like I don’t really care, but it’s a nice surprise. And then very casually, “Wanna see the roof?” The roof. Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest. What’s so special about the roof? Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline. You can’t not fall in love on that roof. We do it up there sometimes. Solid plan, my little friend. We’re the same height. But may I suggest one little modification. That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her! Crazy monkey-style. That’s not the plan. Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She’s smokin’! Thank you. Yeah, but she’s not Robin. Exactly! Ted, let’s wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there’s always a girl who has no idea whose party she’s at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see—where I’m going—hu-with this? Barney, I don’t wanna say— Aargh!  Scoping, beep, scoping, beep! Man you’re a dork. beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it’s time we play a little game I like to call “Have You Met Ted?” No, come on not this. Hi! Have you met Ted? No. Hi. Hi. Do you know Marshall? Lily? No. Hmm, do you know anyone at this party? I work with Carlos. Excuse me,  Anyone know a Carlos? No. No. On a silver platter! Bon appetite! I don’t think so. Your loss, her gain.  Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It’s magical up there! Sure Whoa-whoa—Hey hey. I got that roof reserved! Dude, Robin’s not coming. Hey, she’s goanna show up.  She’ll show up. She didn’t show up. At least it was a great party. I ate like four whole cans of dip! You always know what to say old friend. It’s Robin. Answer it! No, no, no. Not right away. I gotta seem casual.  Hello? I’m so sorry I missed your party. Who is this? Merideth? Robin. Oh, Robin! Hey, yeah, guess you never showed up did you? no I got stuck at work, but they finally got that kid out of the crane machine. Did he get to keep the purple giraffe? Yeah, they let him keep all the toys. He was in there a long time and little kids have smaller bladders. I wish your party was tonight. It is the party’s tonight.  So that was Robin. What are you doing to me, man. I got a paper to write. I know I’m sorry. It’s terrible TED! TED WAIT—GET FRENCH ONION.  but it’s gotta be like super quick. Oh! And no cuddling after. I’m the luckiest girl alive Scene Five Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking—she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her? I have no idea who that is. She said she works with Carlos, who’s Carlos? I don’t know any Carlos. Grr.  Hi, you. You’re back. I sure am . Come on, sweetie, I need a drink. “sweetie”? Really?   Sweetie? Whoa—Whoa rabbits! Come on, I got that roof reserved. Alright. So, it’s over between me—and—works with Carlos girl. Oh, that was fast. Yeah, I was trying to think what’s the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met? I think I’m in love with you. What? Thanks, bro Glad I could help. What the—no, no, no, no—come on! Sorry, Ted. Great! What am I going to do when Robin shows up.  She’ll show up. She didn’t show up. Alright, we threw two parties. Everybody had fun. Everybody wanged, everybody chunged. Now the kid has got to get to work, and the kid is not to be disturbed. Repeat after me, “I will not have sex with Marshall”. I will not have sex with Marshall. It’s Robin.  Hello? Hi, Ted. Amanda? Oh, Denise—Sorry you totally sounded like Amanda It’s Robin. Oh, Robin——Hi. I totally wanted to come; I got stuck at work again. I feel like I live there. I’m sorry I missed your party…again. Hey, ain’t no thing but a chicken wing mamacita.   WHO AM I? I guess there’s no change your two-dayer turned into a three-dayer. Yeah. Last night people were like, “KEEP IT GOIN’ BRO! PARTY TRIFECTA!” Wow, okay—well I’ll be there. Great, see you tonight.  So that was Robin. Scene Six So I threw a third party for Robin. On a Sunday night Oh, this is lame. lame or “Casual”? lame. Or “Casual”? Hey little old books. Ready for a little fifteen minute recess? Sorry, baby, I gotta work. I need all my blood  Anybody seen a big-ass book? No, no. Hello, Barney. Of course. You look well. Isn’t it weird they invited both of us? Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are! I understand you’re hurt, but, you don’t have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you. Who is Carlos!? Okay, where the hell is my—OHH! so you threw all these parties for me? No! Oh you thought that—oh, no! I c—okay yes. You got me—I——Anyway Robin, this is. Carlos Ohhh. Scene Six She’s still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it’s not over. Okay, buddy, time for the “tough-talk”. Robin seems great. But let’s look at the facts, you wanna get married and right now there’s a million women in New York looking for exactly you, but Robin ain’t one of them. She’s not just “one of them” she’s the one. Yeah well, “the one” is heading up to “the roof”. What are you gonna do? Nothing. It’s a game, I gotta just—keep playing it. Hey. Hey. Carlos, can you give us a minute? Hey, no sweat hombre. Robin, look I didn’t invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that.  I threw these parties because I wanted to see you. Well, here I am. There’s something here, look, unless I’m crazy. Like what? like—let’s fall in love, and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice. I’m not gonna force sports on them unless they’re interested. It’s a great look. But you’re looking at the wrong girl. No, I’m not. Yes, you are. I don’t wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I’d feel like I’d either have to marry you or break your heart and—I just couldn’t do either of those things. Just like you can’t turn off the way you feel. Click. Off. Let’s make out. What? What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but—on the other hand… you… me…the roof. There’s no off switch. There is an off switch… and it’s off. no, it’s not. No …it’s—not. Yes—it is  No it’s not. You’re right, there’s no off switch. God I wish there was an off switch. me too. So we could be friends Oh look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but… we could. I don’t know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it’ll be like, “Oh—that’s right—I’m a jackass.” You’re not a jackass. I’m sorry. I only moved here in April and I’m always working and—I just haven’t met a lot of good people so far. But I understand. Well—uh—maybe in a few months after it’s not so fresh, we could all—uh…you know, get a beer. yeah. Or, you know—now.  We could all get a beer now. I’d like that. My friends are goanna love you—like you—you know, as a friend.  Jackass. Unbelievable. That is just a recipe for disaster, they work together You jealous? Oh, please, what does Carlos have that I don’t? a date tonight? Ohh!! Stop the tape, rewind—play it again. Ohh!! I’m not sure I like her. Hey, don’t you have a paper to write? Dude, you’re talking to the kid. I know it. I’m goanna knock back this beer. I’m gonna knock back one more beer. I’m gonna go home, I’m gonna write a twenty-five page paper. I’m gonna hand it in and I’m gonna get a A. My name is Rufus, and that’s the Trufus. He got a B Minus. But still—twenty-five pages in one night, B minus? The kid was good. At least let me buy you a beer. Come on I’ll buy everyone a beer. I’ll help carry. You know something, Ted? What? You are a catch. You’re gonna make some girl very happy, and I am going to help you find her. Well, good luck. I mean maybe New York’s just too big a town, you know?  There’s millions of people in this city. How in all this mess is a guy supposed to find the love of his life? I mean, where do you even begin? Hi, Have you met Ted? So there was this one night, before I met your mother when I really wanted to go to the bar. The bar ? Big surprise ! You sure spend a lot of time in bars… Well that’s just what we did back then. Me. Marshall and Lily. Barney We all used to hang out at this one bar called “MacLaren’s”. But then one night. Why don’t we go to MacLaren’s ? Let’s go to MacLaren’s. You guys talking to each other ? Nobody’s listening. What’s wrong with MacLaren’s ? It’s going to be legendary. I had no idea why I hung out with Barney. You didn’t phone-five did you ? I know when you don’t phone-five, Ted. Come on, we always go to MacLaren’s. Yeah, cause MacLaren’s is fun… MacLaren’s is this much fun. What I’m offering is the chance to have this much fun. See, you say that. You say it’s going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good ! It’s safe. It’s guaranteed ! This hand gesture thing doesn’t really work on the phone, does it ? No it doesn’t. Get in the cab. Marshall you too. Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi... I understand.  Get in the cab. Why can Marshall say no ? Uhh... because he’s getting laid. Consistently. I am a rut buster. I’m going to bust your rut . It’s not a rut, okay. It’s a routine and I like it ! Ted, what’s the first syllable in rutting Alright, so what’s this legendary plan. First we got to pick someone up at the airport. Okay, I’m outta here. Just this one little thing and the rest of the night is ours. Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up ? I don’t know. Maybe her ? Or her. Wait so when you said you were going to “pick someone up at the airport”. You meant you were going to “pick someone up at the airport”. Scenario. Couple of girls fly into town, looking for a fun weekend in NYC when they meet two handsome international business men just back from a lucrative trip to Japan. Sample dialogue, "You have a wheelie bag ? Wh... I have a wheelie bag !" You’ve gotta be kidding me. False. Sidebar, tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy. I’m sketchy ? Trust me, it’s going to be legendary. Don’t say “legendary”, okay ? You’re too liberal with the word legendary. We’re building an igloo in Central Park. It’s gonna be legendary. Snow suit up ! Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here ! This is happening. Now you can either put your bags on the carousel now, or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you to put the bags on the carousel. Your move. That night, Marshall had a ton of studying to do. So Lily went out with Robin who was new to New York and looking for a friend. I’m so glad we finally get to hang out just the two of us ! Yeah. You sure you’re okay giving up your Friday night to hang with an old almost-married lady ? Oh please, I’m so sick of the “meet-market” scene. Guys are like a subway. You miss one, another one comes along in five minutes. Unless it’s the end of the night, then you get on anything. Heyow ! Compliments of that guy. Really ? Sweet. Oh, for you it’s six dollars. I guess that’s one drawback to being engaged. I’m sure that’s why he didn’t... Hey. Oh. Oh, hello ! Okay, carousel four is tapped out. Ready ? Because I’m about to drop some knowledge. Cute girls are not from Buffalo. Time-out. Ten o’clock. You ready to rock this, Tedder ? Alright, um, I think we need to refine our back-story first. How did we... Ted, you klutzy, great guy, you ! Oh, my god.  Are you okay ? I... I’m so sorry. It’s fine, oh, you were a little shaky on your landing. I’d give you a 9.2. So, hi... I’m Ted. Laura. Oh, where’re you headed ? Philadelphia. Philly ? That’s where we’re headed ! You are ? Well...uh...guess we’ll see you on the plane. Yes, you will.  Follow them, tickets on me. No, Barney. Don’t you get on that escalator ! And don’t you dare get on that subsequent escalator ! Studyin’ law. Making a responsible choice for my future… on a Friday Night. Bein’ a lawyer had better be awesome. What’s up, Ted ? Are you alright ? Yeah. Hey, guess where I am ? I’m on a... ready ? Plane to... ready ? ...Philadelphia. That is awesome. Hey, is that Marshall ?  Marshall, stop whatever you’re doing, get in that hoopty-ass Vierro of yours and come meet us in Philly. It’s going to be legendary. Man, I wish I could, guys, but... Yeah, yeah, yeah... I sent you some pictures on my phone, check it.  Admit it, you’re having fun. This much fun. Thirty-five thousand feet of fun ! Well I didn’t think we’d be on a flying to Philadelphia when I woke up this morning, I’ll give you that. Let’s go talk to those girls. Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on. Ted, you’ve been living your whole life in a seatbelt. It’s time to unclick. Sir, seatbelt light’s on. Yeah, sorry, sorry. So I grew up in Park Slope. Oh, I love Park Slope. When did you move to Manhattan ? You’re from Park Slope. So where’re you from ? Heaven. Yeah, I’m a ghost ! Died fifteen years ago, like that pickup line. Heyow. God, I’m so sorry. Oh, believe me I’ve been there. I have this line that I use when guys come  Check it out. Hey. You take this one, I’ll save it for the next one. So what brings you guys to Philly ? We’re visiting our boyfriends. I think Chris is going to propose this weekend ! Isn’t that great. So great. So there we were, stuck on a plane to Philadelphia with two very unsingle girls. All thanks to your Uncle Barney. Aren’t they cute ? They’re both linebackers for the Eagles. Both ?  Both of their boyfriends are linebackers. You’re going to Philly ? Why... I...I didn’t ask. Well it sounds like you’re having a lot more fun than I am. I’m just talking to guys’ backs while they hit on Robin. Ouff, yeah... I bet she gets that a lot. Don’t you bet I get that a lot ? Not with a ring on your finger. I mean, you know, guys see the ring and it’s like Cha-Chung ! Marshall parking only. Oh, of course, that’s it the ring ! I guess I’m not used to it yet. Oh, it’s totally the ring. If you took that ring off your finger, you’d have a ton o’ guys crowding around your junk. I’m not going to take off my ring ! Wouldn’t you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax ? Bye. Robin ! Robin.  Hey, I’m over here. G-g-g-going to Philly ! Marshall, don’t come to Philly. But we’re on an adventure ! We’re on a Tarmac in Philadelphia, crazy adventure. Passengers Mosby and Stinson ? Please come with us, gentlemen. Keep your hands where I can see them. Barney, I am going to kill you. Don’t say you’re going to kill someone in front of airport security, not cool.  Not cool. This is an outrage. We are international businessmen on an international business trip. I demand you release us immediately. You demand !? No, no, no, no, no... he does not demand. We... we... we have no demands ! Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to remain calm. Okay, yeah. I’m calm... I’m totally calm. We got footage of you placing two bags on JFK carousel three, and abandoning them to purchase a last minute flight with cash. Those bags were your responsibility. They were your bags. Sir, please. We’re assessing the bag situation. Look, this is all just... it’s a misunderstanding. We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting. Can’t remember the last time I saw an international business man with an untucked shirt. In addition, we received this footage taken over the last few months. Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked. Truth is, my friend... he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls and we followed some here to Philadelphia. That’s it ! That’s all this is ! Nobody’s that lame. Yes, he’s that lame. Tell them you’re that lame ! We are international businessmen... OH COME ON ! Sir ! Lower your voice or we’ll restrain you. Dude, seriously, relax. We at least get to call our lawyer. Exactly !  We have a lawyer ? To Philly ! The adventure continues ! Destroy ! It’s ridiculous in here, why don’t we go somewhere else ? What are you doing ? What ? With your lips and everything... ? My lips are always like this You had to play the race card. Relax, Ted. We didn’t do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we’d be out of here by now if you’d have tucked in your shirt. Go ahead, JFK... what is the baggage status ? )Cut to JFK Airport, Carousel three with the Bomb Squad) They’re clean. It’s just a whole bunch of condoms… and a power bar. You’re free to go. Don’t come to Philly. Man, I’m almost half way there ! Yeah, we just got released and we’re heading back on the next flight. Meet us at MacLaren’s maybe we can still make last call. Can’t we just... just... No, we can’t just... we’re going home ! We’re going to Sascha’s ? Who the hell is Sascha ? Sascha.  She’s having friends over for drinks at her house. It’s goanna be legen... wait for it...and I hope you’re not lactose intolerant ‘cuz the second half of that word is... dairy. No. Legendary ! Legendary, that sounds awesome ! No, Marshall, we’re going back. Hello. Marshall, we’re going to Sascha’s ! No, we’re not. Yes, we are. Ooh, look a booth opened up. Really. Yeah, I thought we could finally go talk, and you’re not listening to me, so I’m going to walk away. Yeah, yeah...booth Hey. I took my ring off ! It’s very, very sweet of you to come over and talk to me, but I... just... Yeah, I’m gay. Just came over to let you know that you sat on a grape. Oh, damn it ! So, Barney and I hit the town. Philadelphia, PA. Our first and only stop... Sascha’s party. So, uh… you’re Sascha’s friends, huh ? You know it. Philly ! Shh ! Philly ! Back at the bar, the girls night out wasn’t going as Robin had hoped. Lily’s phone. Robin ! Uh... Where’s Lily She’s uh... Is she talking to some hot guy ? Oh, you can tell me. It’s totally cool. It was my idea ! Hell, I told her she could take the ring off. Really ? Well I thought it was kinda weird, but if you’re cool with it. Yeah. It’s off and she’s talking to some guy. Do you want me to go over and... I can’t breathe ! Did you hear that, Ted ? Dana works security at the Liberty Bell. I do okay. Wow it must be really well cornered off over there. You ever go behind the rope and touch it ? Only all the time. Ever, like, stick your head inside it ? Yeah. D’you ever lick it ? Nope, I have never licked it. Hmm… I bet nobody in history has ever licked the Liberty Bell ! If someone were to pull that off I dare say it would be... what’s the word ? Well, this is my stop. Legendary, Ted, LEGENDARY ! Barney, I’m going to the airport. Sascha, thank you... and uh... tell your grandpa I’m sorry I walked in on him in the bathroom. I’ll get some Club Soda for that stain. Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out, what are you doing ? Just fending up the advances of that totally hot guy. Dude, I think that guy is gay. Oh, I know that guy is gay. Just Marshall and I have been together for nine years. I haven’t been single since high school. You wanna be single ?  You wanna fight off loser guys all night, does that seem like fun to you ? I guess I wanted to throw this net back into the ocean and see how many fish I could catch. So far, one. One gay dolphin. And Marshall. Lily, all these girls here tonight are looking to catch what you’ve already got. You’re right I know. Hey do you wanna get some coffee and have an actual conversation ? If, by “Coffee” you mean “Cheesecake”, then yes. Oh, thank you so much. Marshall  You wanna mess pal ? That’s my fiancé’s hot backside that you’re dabbing. Marshall, no. Baby, please don’t ever take that ring off again. No matter how awesome I say that it is. It’s okay, man... BACK OFF HOMBRE. I’m not that afraid to fight you. You wanna test this guy ? Be my guest ! Marshall, he’s gay ! Oh, thank god... I’ve never been in a fight before. You don’t say ! So it turns out Uncle Marshall really was the jealous type. Unfortunately, that guys boyfriend... also the jealous type. Hey ! Could have licked the Liberty Bell. We’re going to the airport. Bong, bong… Why do I hang out with you ? Why ? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city ! Ted, Ted… you’re not even looking. No, I’m not. You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it ! That was beautiful, man ! Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you’re missing out on a valuable life lesson ! Look, I don’t need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself. No, it has to be the two of us. Why ? Why do you need me? Because, you’re my best friend, alright ? You don’t have to tell me I’m yours. But the way I see it, we’re a team. Without you, I’m just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home… then we’ll go home. Fine…we’ll go lick the Liberty Bell ! Good, I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like ? What ? Freedom… No actually it tasted like pennies. My, god. Did you guys really do that ? We really did and that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney. I never got where I thought I wanted to go, but I always got a great story. The Year 2030] So, that girl you were talking to... that was mom ? Kids, every story in a man’s life is like a dot in an impressionist’s painting. And when you... So that’s a no ? Yeah, that’s a no.  What ? Come on ! Kids, when you’re single all you’re looking for is happily ever after. A shirt ? Just listen… Because none of this would have happened if it hadn’t have been for that shirt. Wow. Nice shirt ! Right ? Right ? Look at those colors ! Green and brown together at last ! Hot top, Bro, is it new ? That’s the crazy part. I’ve had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn’t into it at all, but now it’s like my tastes have changed. Booger. Yes, hello, Barney. Barney’s offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report. Not some stupid word, “Booger”. But I’m not doing it, I am a journalist. What ? Journalist ? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that’s not journalism, that’s just things in a diaper. For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to the City Hall beat. City hall, Miss Thang ! So I’m not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying “Booger” for fifty bucks. Of course not, because now you’re saying “Nipple” and it’s a hundred !  Step into my web. Mmm... Who’s bourbon is this ? Ooh, I don’t know. It was here when we sat down. Aaah, point is. I seem to like bourbon now. I could have sworn I hated bourbon. First the shirt, now bourbon. I spent twenty-seven years making up my mind about things, right ? The movie I saw once in Haden, the city I’ll never go back to because it was raining the day I visited. Maybe it’s time to start forming some second impressions... You’re finally gonna watch "Goonies AGAIN ? Slow love, Chuck". Not Goonies, girls. What if there’s someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit ? Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you’ve already dated. Breast, Implants. That’s not a bad idea. Let’s think, Ted’s greatest hits... what about that girl, Steph ? Steph... Okay, this is difficult to say, back when I lived in LA, I was pretty broke, so I spent a month making adult films. Wow, okay... how many did you make ? A-hundred-and-seventy-five. Say what you will about the porn industry... they are hard workers. What about that chick...um...Jackie ? And my bathing suit had fallen completely off. Uh...no. What about Natalie ! Natalie ! Who’s Natalie ? Natalie, I had so many fond memories of her. The tea candles on her dresser. The sock monkey collection on her bed. That one Belle and Sebastian song that she always listened to. Her smile. Man, I haven’t seen her in like three years ! Well why’d you guys break up ? I just wasn’t looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn’t seem so bad... maybe I should call her ? What do you guys think ? You dumped a porn star ? Friendship over  FRIENDSHIP OVER ! Come in, You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams ? Yes, I did. I need you to cover a story.  It’s down at City Hall. City Hall ?   Oh, my god. So, next time you’re passing City Hall, make sure and stop by New York’s oldest hotdog cart. Today a delicious hotdog will cost you $2.50, but back when the stand first opened in 1955, you could get one for only a nipple. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One. I said, “Nipple” on the news ! That was so unprofessional ! I said, “Nipple” on the news ! At least it’s better than booger.  Booger. There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin’s nickels ? Now for your next challenge... No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don’t care how much you offer me. Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn’t about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side’s good for you, me and Mr. McGee. Seriously, who talks like that ? Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven’t promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby’s going to look in the camera and say this Eew. I’m just assuming. I gotta get back to work. See ya. Bye. Baby’s going to think about it. Found it ! I found Natalie’s number. Hey, Ted. Nice shirt ! Is it yesterday already ? Thank you. I am calling her; this is crazy I haven’t talked to her in, like, three years. I wonder if she even remembers me. Hello ? Natalie, its Ted Mosby. Go to hell. She remembers me. Why would Natalie hang up on you ? I don’t know ! Did you sleep with her sister ? No. Sleep with her mom ? No. I’m losing interest in your story. Well, you must have done something. Why did you guys break up ? He wasn’t ready for a commitment. Uh-huh. And her birthday might have been coming up. Uh-huh... Okay, so I didn’t wanna get a boyfriend level gift for a girl I was just about to break up with. So you dumped her right before her birthday ? No, I didn’t dump her… right before her birthday. Uh-oh. Natalie ! Hey, Happy Birthday ! Listen... Never...break...up...with...a...girl...on...her...birthday ! LILY WAIT, THE SHIRT ! I KNOW, IT WAS A MISTAKE ! Well, did she cry her eyes out ? I don’t know. How do you n...Oh, you didn’t ! Natalie ! Hey, Happy Birthday !  Listen... you’re awesome. You really are... awesome. I’m just like super busy right now, so... maybe we should just... call it a day. But you’re awesome. On...her...answering...machine !? And...on...her... birthday ? Oh... who... breaks... up... with... somebody... on... their... answering... machine... on... their... birthday ?! Yeah, dude, email ! Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall. That is a terrible way to break up with someone. Okay, in my client’s defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody ? No. Personally I’d rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person.  It’s the least painful way you can do it. Who are you calling ? Know, that was a big mistake, Ted. You should’ve done it in person. Thank you. Desperate “Please-don’t-leave-me” sex is amazing. Okay, it was childish and stupid, I just...I didn’t want to see her cry. Well guess what ? She cried ! You just didn’t have the sack to face those tears. That was me then, okay ? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I’m gonna make this right. You know what else ? My younger sister just got married and I’m about to turn thirty-sex. Fantastic. An occasion that was supposed to be joyous suddenly turned tragic when Ethel and Sadie Marsolis, New York’s oldest twins, suddenly passed away on this, the eve of their one hundredth birthday. I’m a dirty, dirty girl . Ow. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One. Joel Adam’s wants to see you in his office Before you say anything, I just want to say, I really like working here at Metro News One. That’s great. So my dog keeps going What ? Well you have dogs, right ? What do you... what do you think that means ? Take him to the vet ? Genius.  That’s one I owe you. Was that all ? Yeah. And nothing about the twins’ story ? Oh, yeah, great job on that one. New York loves you. You’re a superstar, bye-bye. That’s when Robin realized, no one, not even her boss, watched Metro News One. Hi. Natalie. Come on, I just want to say I’m sorry. I only came down here because you wouldn’t take my call. I have an idea. Why don’t you leave a message ? Goodbye. Natalie... I. OH ! OKAY, okay... I... look, look. I know you’re mad. Happy Birthday  Three years ago. Oh yeah ? Up yours... three years ago No, look... I was an idiot for leaving that message. I realize how much that sucked. No you don’t. Surprise... There was a surprise party that night ?  How come nobody told me ? People think I can’t keep a secret but I totally can ! Sorry, not the issue... Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid back then, terrified of commitment. And I suppose you’re suddenly ready to get married and settle down ? Well, yeah, actually . I’m a different guy now. Give me another chance. You must think I have absolutely no self respect. Come on... Just a cup of coffee. Wow. Maybe it was the caffeine, but you really brought your game up to a whole new level. Thanks. I did just start subscribing to esquire. They have some helpful columns. The following, is from the October issue. So, Natalie and I started dating again and just like that it all came back. The tea candles. The Sock monkeys. Belle and Sebastian... all of it. It seemed like happily ever after wasn’t far off. Well I better run, I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour. Krav Maga, how cool is it that she does Krav Maga ? Thanks honey. Hmm... Bye, guys. Bye. Dude, what’s Krav Maga ? I have no idea. Some kind of yoga ? You know, that Natalie... she’s good times. Yeah, she’s like the best girl you’ve dated in years. Yeah, Ted, hold on to that one. Yeah, I have to break up with her. I don’t get it, man, Natalie is awesome. I know, she’s terrific, but I have to break up with her. Why... couldn’t... you... leave... that... poor... girl... alone ? I know ! I hate this. These past three weeks have been great. I should be in love with her, but I’m not feeling that thing. It’s ineffable. Ineffable... good word. So when are you going to do it ? She’s probably on the subway by now. You could call her Voice Mail. Beep, dumped. Click. Done ! I have to do this face-to-face. I just... I don’t know what I’m going to say ! “I’m not ready for a commitment.” Oh, that’s such a cliché. It’s not a cliché, it’s a classic. It’s the stairway to heaven of breakup lines. Well, I think Natalie deserves better. Better. There’s no better in breaking up. There’s only less awful. A cliché’s a cliché for a reason. It’s comforting. It doesn’t matter, I already told her I am ready for a commitment, so... oh, my god... there’s no way out... I’m going to have to marry her. No, no. We’re going to get you out of this. Okay, how about... “It’s not you it’s me” ? Mm... Mm ! Six words ! You... look... fat... in... those... jeans..., you’re free to go. Ted, have you considered telling her the truth ? Seriously, honey, men are working, here. Ted, what is the truth ? Why do you want to break up with her ? The truth ? She’s not the one. So, tell her that. Oh, you can’t tell her that. That’s horrible. Why ? What is so horrible about that ? Yeah, what is so horrible about that ? ...“She’s not the one.” Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear ? The chances of one person being another person’s “The one” are like six billion to one. Yeah, you have better chances of winning the lottery. Exactly, you wouldn’t take it personally if you lost the lottery. Alright, man, tell her the truth. She’s goanna cry. Yeah, and he’s going to sit there and he’s going to take it like a man. I have to do the mature thing. Want to talk mature ? I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs. For one thousand dollars, you heard me, all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these... What the hell is that ? The Ickey Shuffle. And as you do it, you say this, “Elbert Ickey Woods. The bangles were fools to cut you in ’91. Your 1521 rushing yards and your 27 touch downs will not be forgotten. So Coach Dave Shullah, screw you and your crappy steakhouse." Just write it down for me. What do I care, it’s not like anyone’s watching anyway, right ? Man, she’s gonna cry. Slow loves junk Thanks, Lil. So the next night I took Natalie out to dinner. To do the mature thing. Look, uh, Natalie there’s something I have to say. Oh wait, wait. There’s something I have to say first. Today at work, I had not one, not two, but three birthday cakes, so tonight; can we just skip the cake ? Today is your birthday ? Yeah, no that’s okay... I wasn’t telling anyone about it. Today’s your birthday! I... I didn’t get you anything. Oh, it’s okay. You know you’ve already given me the best present of all. I can trust again. You’re welcome.  Oh, so much more wine. West 53rd Street, Horse Stable Henry, as New York’s oldest handsome cab driver, you’ve seen quite a lot. In your past sixteen years on the job what is your most exciting memory ? Well... Ahh ! This is it. Oh, boy, here we go. Everyone, everyone... If I may direct your attention to the television. You’re about to see something... amazing. And them, in ’72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time. Come on, baby... bring it home. But the most exciting moment, that would have to be this one, right now. What ? Look at me, I’m on TV. I never thought I’d have my story told. Thank you, Miss Robin Scherbatsky. Thank you. And right then, Aunt Robin realized how important her job truly was. It’s an honor to tell your story, Henry. But this reporter takes pride in...  Whoa !! OH ! Oh, my god ! I’m covered in horse crap ! It’s in my hair !! Oh my, ow... ow my knee. You planned that ? No, Marshall. That was beyond my wildest dreams So, if you ever come to Alabama, my mom throws these huge crawfish boils and she’s just dying to meet you, by the way. Look, Natalie, there’s something I have to say and there’s no good way to say it. I wanna break up. I don’t think you’re the one for me. I don’t want to waste your time because I really like you. I wanna do right by you, and I think the best way to do that is just to be honest. I’m sorry.  Aah ! I’m not the one for you ? I’m sorry. I just thought the mature thing to do would be... It’s my birthday ! Yes, I know I didn’t realize that it was... It’s my birthday and you’re telling me I’m not the one for you ? It’s really not such a big deal. I mean it’s the odds. It’s like you lost the lottery. Oh, so dating you is like winning the lottery ? No, no, no. I didn’t mean that. Okay, So what’s the problem ? It’s... I can’t explain it. TRY ! It’s... ineffable. I’m not “F-able” ? No, no, no, no. Ineffable, ineffable means it can’t be explained. Oh, so I’m stupid ? Oh, god what’s going on? Okay, “what’s going on” is, you broke my heart over my answering machine... on my birthday, waited three years for me to get over you. Tracked me down, begged me to go out with you again only so you could dump me three weeks later. Again on my birthday ! No, it’s... it’s not like that. I’m just... it’s, it’s, it’s. WHAAAT !? I’m just like super busy right now. Remember when Natalie said. I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour. Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga. It’s a form of gorilla street fighting developed by the Israeli army. This is compliments of those two gentlemen at the bar. My knee ! It’s in my hair ! But isn’t it nice to know that people are watching ? Oh, my god. Are you alright ? What happened to you ? Told the truth, turns out the truth has a mean round house kick. Oh, man. Oh, well you did the right thing. I’m proud of you. I’m bleeding internally. Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I’m down ? Other people’s misfortune. You missed something so amazing. Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn’t see it ? Fine. Are you okay ? I really thought I was going the good way this time. I guess there is no good way. Sometimes no matter how hard you try to do the right thing, you just end up flat on your back flailing around in a big pile of horse crap ! You saw it ? It’s going against the internet now ! It’s okay, grow up. And that’s how it ended with Natalie. No happily ever after. Just a whole lot of hurt. And just like that all those wonderful memories were replaced. By this one But you know, bad as that night was... within a year Natalie was married. With three beautiful children. So that’s the up side of her. Sometimes it happens for a reason. The Year 2030] Wow, so you beat up by a girl ? Is that all you’re taking away from this story ? You got beat up by a girl ? Hey, she knew Krav Maga. So kids, would you like to hear the story of the time I went deaf ? Why does he even ask ? I know, he’s just going to tell us anyway. I sure am. It all began. When Robin strolled into the bar and said. Say you’re my bitch. I’m your bitch. Why this time ? Because tonight, I am getting us all into “Okay”. “Okay” !? Awesome !! What’s going on, did I just have a stroke ? “Okay” is the name of a club. Yeah, it’s supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn’t get in. A friend of yours named you ? No… a friend of mine named, shut up. Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I’m on the list for tonight. Nice going, Scherbatsky. You’re becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name. He’s even getting me into the VIP room. Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean… Okay, what does “VIP” stand for in your universe ? … I know that the “P” is penis. Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily ? Why was this funny ? I’ll explain. You see. Lily was a kindergarten teacher. And so, one fateful naptime… Austin and I spent Saturday night at the most charming bed and breakfast. It was so nice. What did you do this weekend ? CHUG, CHUG, CHUG TEN SECONDS !! SUCK IT LOSERS ! You know, quiet time with the fiancé. I don’t know, I just felt embarrassed. Claire is my age, and she and her husband do all these classy grownup stuff. Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff. That was some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning. Yeah, but it wasn’t classy. Maybe we should have a wine tasting party. I like wine. I like tasting. You know I can party, let’s do it. Let’s rock it, maturity style ! Ever since then she’s been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes… All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from. So, no. Lily and Marshall will not be doing this. my friend Kelly’s going to be there. Kelly, who supposedly I’m gonna love? Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She’s fun, she’s smart, she lives in the moment. Translation, she’s ugly, she’s ugly, she ugs in the ugly. Oh, and she’s totally hot. Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening. So, do you have any other hot single fr… No, Kelly works with the news breakers… Oh, no, Ted, your blazer ! What, what, what… ? Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it. Love it ! Thank you. And his hair was perfect. Hey we’re wearing the same shirt ! Oh, wait no that’s just my shirt reflected in yours. You really never read my blog, do you ? Alright, Tin-Man. Let’s hit it. Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys. What the hell happened to these two ? Marshall and I are just growing up. Yeah, it’s going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we’re tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses… Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay. Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa… don’t wait up. My, oh, my there are some ferocious looking cutlets here tonight. Alright, hookup strategy, colon, find a cutlet; lock her in early, grind with her all night till she’s mine. Do strategies ever work for you ? do these strategies ever not work for me ? Either way the answer’s “about half the time”. We’ll wait here… …And with todays interest rate climbing, you gotta go for the thirty year fixed mortgage. Oh, totally.  So, Marshall, what about you ? You guys thinking house, baby ? Ah ! Ah, no I think we’re going to wait on the baby thing. I mean I love babies. Babies rule. Pudgy arms and stuff, but they make you old. Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot…forever. I’m three month’s pregnant. I don’t know guys. It’s not awkward unless we let it be awkward. This place seems great. Is Kelly here ? Yeah, she’s around somewhere. Let’s go find her, I’ll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn’t it, who get’s to be in VIP and who doesn’t ? Can we come ? It’s… not that arbitrary… Whoa… this place in lourd ! You think ? Okay, it’s a little loud. You want to go somewhere we can talk ? …Okay… You think it was kind of weird that Ted didn’t invite me out with him ? Why, you’d rather be out at some dance club, all noisy and sweaty with the… Is this what you want ? Let’s start drinking ! Oh, not so fast. In order for the tannins to mellow, you should let it breathe for about thirty minutes. Freaking ten ends. So, how do you know Robin ? Sagittarius. Is that near Westchester ? You know what they’re doing in there right now ? They’re watching Claire’s ultrasound video and I swear to god even the baby looks bored. Come on, it’s not that bad. We’re really starting to click with these guys. Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night. You’re also trying to get me excited about fondue ? It’s dipping stuff in hot cheese, what’s not to love ? Okay, that does sound good. But it’s dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people. Marshall, it’s time for us to grow up. Marshall knew she was right. He had to stop acting like a kid. But not tonight. Now our apartment was on the third floor, so I’m not sure if this part is actually true, but Uncle Marshall swears it happened. Taxi ! “34”. “14” ? “34” “7” ? “34 !” The new album is great; it’s all smooth and polished, not all dark and heavy like the early stuff. Oh, yeah. Norah Jones just gets better and better. Please tell me we can drink the wine now. Five more minutes, we don’t want to rush to tannins. Freaking tannins. I think that’s when I realized, clubs weren’t awesome. Clubs weren’t even “okay”. Clubs sucked. I had to get out of there. Hey, Robin. Hey ! Why aren’t you inside ? I’m calling the owner, there’s a guy in there who won’t let me in to the stupid VIP room. What are you doing here ? Oh, I had this move. So I came here to bust it. Can you get me in ? Great, voicemail. Thanks, I’ll see ya. Bye. Oh, come on ! He just got here ! Probably famous. Oh yeah, isn’t there a third Affleck Brother ? Keith Affleck or Brian Affleck or something ? Holy Crap. We just saw Brian Affleck ! Oh, um… I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky, I’m on the list. Name’s already crossed off, sorry. But, I’m Robin Scherbatsky. I’m a reporter for channel one. There’s a channel one ? Back of the line ! You shoulda snuck in with Brian Affleck. I’m bailing, see ya. Oh hey, I can’t see her face. Is she hot ? Hi. Nice eyes. Cute smile. Out of your league. Aah ! Coat wench do not uncheck that man’s jacket. Sorry, just being dramatic. You’re not a wench. No, no, no. Coat wench, I like it. I should get a sign made of it. What are you doing here ? Lily let you go ? Lily ? Pfft. Who cares right ? You are so dead. Oh, I’m so dead. Wow. Uh… I’m going home. Aah ! I put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line to party with my bro. Now damn it, we’re gonna party. Alright, one beer. Yes, finally I don’t have to wait half an hour for a drink. One Half Hour Later…] Yeah. No tannins. Oh man, I can’t believe I forgot to tell you this. This is important to the story. Earlier that day, Marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in. Okay, so anyway. Marshall, are you okay ? Again, I wasn’t there. So I’m a little foggy on the details. Taxi ! Hey. Hey. Marshall just ditched out on our own party. Can you get me in there ? I kind of need to kill him. Actually, I can’t even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I’m Julia Roberts. No VIP. I’m not even an IP. I’m just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter. Know something; I’d take a pee in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day. Broke my tooth. …Do you have… …any aspirin ? Maybe theres… a machine in… The restroom. Now to this day, I don’t know what happened in there. But when Marshall came out a few minutes later, Rough night ? Yeah, these clubs are supposed to be fun, right ? Why do I hate them so much ? Because all of the stuff you’re supposed to like… usually sucks. Like these clubs or cruises. Or New Year’s Eve. Or the Super Bowl. Or parades. The rockettes. Or parades. You said that already. I really hate parades. He just left, in the middle of our own party, you don’t do that. Unless, of course, you’re chasing after someone who’s already done it, and then I think it’s okay. Well, I hate to take his side… but come one a wine tasting ? What’s the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night ? Don’t check your email. Why are you becoming this person ? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare. Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I’m not in college anymore. I’d love to go back and be that person again, but you can’t move backwards you can only go forward. Um, pause… you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go ? I want to go into this club and find my fiancé. Well that you can’t do. Wanna bet ?  I said follow my lead. “Follow my lead”. Please, please, please. Those were the four greatest and only breasts I have ever seen. Yeah, see, everyone keeps telling you something is supposed to be fun, it’s usually not. Right. Right ! So, by that logic, if you and I were to, say, go out on a date. Then we couldn’t go anywhere that’s supposed to be fun. Right. The DMV it is. Then we’ll get our teeth cleaned. Sounds awful, it’s a date. Okay. But there’s still one big question that needs to be answered. How many of these coats do you think I could put on all at once ? Okay, this question is for the wedge. Barney ?? Barney. Ted, bring your coat, we’re leaving. What ? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with ? That was my cousin, Leslie. What ?! No, no, no… we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we’ll be telling in a couple months. It’s not gonna be like, “Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with… NO ! And you know why ? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I’ll talk to you soon ? Umm, hey… tip her, Barney. Why, I didn’t check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so… Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night… FINE ! Just… eh. That’s a handy new trick. So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth. It was nice, and then it got icky. Eww. I’M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT. I MEAN I KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE I GOT ENGAGED BUT IT WOULD’VE BEEN NICE TO BE ASKED. I’M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU… THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT. I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE’RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU’VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY. WHAT ? YOU CRAZY ? YOU THINK I LIKE GOING TO THOSE CLUBS ? I’D SO MUCH RATHER GO TO YOUR FRUITY LITTLE WINE TASTING. Oh, my god…I’m going to barf. Where’s my purse, where’s my purse ?  I’m okay. PROBLEM IS… YOU CAN’T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I’M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY. WHAT ? BUT MAN, WHEN I FIND HER. WE’RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BADASS WINE TASTINGS. IT’S A PLAN ! HEY MAYBE IT’LL BE THAT CUTE COAT CHECK GIRL ! YEAH, MAYBE IT WILL BE. It wasn’t. YOU KNOW, TED, I DON’T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY… THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS ! LIVING ROOM Aunt Lily BAR Guess what came in the mail today? Our costumes? Do they rule? They rule. And yours is 100% wool so you won't get hypothermia like last year. Tarzan nipple blue. You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse... Wow, we get it. She's a slutty nurse. Robin, what are you doing for Halloween? Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing. Mike? There's a Mike? You have a boyfriend? You haven't told us? No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks. Boyfriend. So why haven't we met him? We're not really ready to go public yet. Married. How about we go about a Halloween double-date? naked people Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun. Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened? Your costumes came. Our costumes...yes, that is why we're best friends. Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween? Well. Awww. What? Every Halloween Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's right. What's the Slutty Pumpkin? You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago. EXT. ROOFTOP I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume. BAR Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy? It was carved in strategic places. So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua... Kahlua and root beer A cocktail she invented herself. And she... And she called it the Tootsie Roll. Because it tastes like an alcoholic Tootsie Roll. So we had this instant connection. Something went terribly wrong. Guys! Something went terribly wrong. APARTMENT Happy Halloween. Sonny, where's Cher? Cher? Right here, babe. She loves Star Wars. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks? Loves them. Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks. Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins. Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve. Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table. I don't know, but we have plenty of chocolate here. No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it? Uh-oh. Hey, Dracula. Come on. Give me your candy. Gimme! Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat! BAR Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be. You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat. I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic. OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife? Oh, on the off chance that that could happen, maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin. APARTMENT Ted, is your world ready to be rocked?  rocked-rocked-rocked. Can't wait. So, what do you think? Wow! Marshall, you wearing eye liner? Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right? We are so gonna win the costume contest this year. First prize, $50 gift certificate at the bar. And how much did you pay for your costumes? $100 Each. Well, I think you guys look great. What are you going as? Oh, like I even have to ask. Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad. What? She thought it was hilarious. Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is. What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history. Sad commentary. All right, Polly gotta pee. Again? Where are you going? It's an elaborate costume. No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up! No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad. Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do. Hm,  Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word. I'm heading up to the roof. Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice.  We out. Hey, Chad, how's it hanging? Hey, word play. Funny. Whoo. Nice outfit. I'm a parrot. You sure are. Where's Mike? He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year. Seriously, does my eye liner look OK? Yes, it's weirdly hot. So, where's your costume? Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up. Oh, geez. Hi. Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair. Where's your costume, Gretel? You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone. I think we got them beat. EXT. ROOFTOP I can't believe you talked me into this. I didn't. You followed me up here. This party sucks. There are seven chicks here. There are six chicks here. Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better. Ladies and gentlemen, as on-pitch as they were at Spring Fling '95, it's my pleasure to welcome back the Shagarats. My bonnie lies over the ocean. My bonnie lies over the sea. My bonnie lives over the ocean. Oh bring back my bonnie to me... BAR What be a pirate's favorite kind of sweater? Arr-gyle. And what be a pirate's favorite fast food restaurant? Arrr-by's Would think it would be Arby's,  but actually it's Long John Silver's. Actually I kinda need this hand to eat. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh, thank you Starrr-ving It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together. Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together. We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's This cheeseburger is so... Good. See. I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby. This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chop. That might be true but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit. Robin, you have to try this chicken. Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks. Really tasty. I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger. Come on, just try a little bite. Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here. Oh for God's sake. Really tasty. EXT. ROOFTOP Hey. Hey. So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah. Right, cuz I'm wearing a lei. It isn't funny if you explain the joke. Let's bail. Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again. Name one person you know at this party. Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he? OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle. Really? That's the nickname now? Yeah, the Barnacle. The Barnacle. That's it. Barnacle out. Have fun, Barnacle. LADIES ROOM So, do you like Mike? Do you like Mike? Of course I do. Why? It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume. Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff. OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it. Are you trying to get me to join a cult? Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him. What? Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night. OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something? How about you start by sharing dessert. I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share. EXT. ROOFTOP Barney. What, you're back? That's right. In a totally new costume. Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression. What's with the face? It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee. So go to the bathroom. No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin. So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof. Whoa, I wouldn't do that if I were you. There's people walking down there. Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there. Yeah, whatever. You guys got some weed? BAR A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down. This is gonna be a slaughter. None of these other costumes even come close to ours. Take the damn picture. Got it. I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher. Maybe if I had worn that red dress. Ha! If I could turn back time. Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing. But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike. Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad. Thanks, Marshmallow. Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven. EXT. ROOFTOP Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight. You wouldn't believe. I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink. You certainly are a charming devil. I'm also a horny devil.  Yeah. No. Oh, go to hell. BAR You know, if you guys like tiramisu we found this little Italian place... No, you found it. I came with you. Go on. I'm just saying we love tiramisu. I cannot get enough of it. We're crazy for this stuff. I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu. We love tiramisu. Am I wrong in saying that. ? No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right? So this Italian place? How's their cannoli? See there, hungry. Yeah, looks like we're both hungry. Hey, is that Gary Oldman? Wait, where? I don't see... Brain freeze. EXT. ROOFTOP OK Victoria's Secret party right now. Nope. Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming. She might. Oy. Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope. Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat! See ya. No, see ya.  Ow. BAR Wanna drink the melty part? You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna take off. Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me. I like being with you. Not as much as you like being alone. You like eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords. Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work. Actually, it kinda does. Wait, are we breaking up? We aren't breaking up. I'm breaking up with you. EXT. ROOFTOP And then just when I was about to lose hope. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins. Kahlua, root beer, could this penguin be the Slutty Pumpkin? Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't ... You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check. Unbelievable. Yes, it is. Wait a minute. You're that lame army guy. What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot I cannot believe I gave you my number Yeah, well, you did, thanks. Well, give it back. Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you. But I'm never gonna go out with you. But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah. Nice. Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go. I'm staying. Fine. Fine. What are you doing? I'm flippering you off. BAR Sweetie, I'm so sorry. Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine. Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. And the winners of this year's costume contest are Lily Aldrin as a parrot and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate. Oh yeah! Wait. What did he say? Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won! Gay pirate, where are you getting that from? Dude, you're wearing eye liner. OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have sex with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won! I love you, Marshmallow. I love you too, Lilypad. You guys, let me get a picture. EXT. ROOFTOP I had a feeling I'd find you here. Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore. I never played any team sports Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps. I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped. Man, that sucks. Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something? No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men. But you're wired just fine. Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel? Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot. Really? Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin.  pumpkin-pumpkin... How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up. 43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait. Scoot. LIVING ROOM Kids, before I met your mother, when I was still out there searching, I learned something valuable, that love is not a science. Wow, that was a great story, Dad. We're gonna go watch TV. You see, sometimes in life, you just have to accept that certain things can't be explained. And that's kinda scary. BAR Oh my God. I know, I'm still shaking. What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold. Another round and back it up for me and Lily. What happened? We saw something, up in the apartment. Something bad. I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy. Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall. Oh my God. What was it? Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen. Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach. Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers. But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae Marshall ran away from a cockroach. It, it was a mouse. Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man. Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up. I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret? Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love. All I have to do is input the variables, run the algorithm, and presto manifesto, you have a soulmate, and it works. Just ask all of my happy couples. And these are just the attractive ones, I have more photos in the bathroom. Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky... BAR Was that chick at the end really a client? Yes. We're signing up. What? Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with. I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat. No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur. It was a cockroach. Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just killed. Oh my God. Come on. APARTMENT (Ted sitting on couch reading magazine, Ted hears squeaking and tiny footstep noises, Barney barges into the apartment_ Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking. What? My boat is sinking. You have a boat? Yes, I bought a boat last year at a police auction. I just got a call from a guy down at the marina that it's leaning starboard at a 45 degree angle. If I don't get there right now, it's gonna capsize. Now, come on! OFFICE Your boat is sinking. That was good. Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step. Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless sex. You deserve more. That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we. Hey, is there anyway I can let it be known that I love cuddling? Oh, of course you can. That is so... It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her? Get out. What? I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again. Oh my God, people do that. You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way? What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out? That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself. OK, Ted, let's go. Not you, you stay. You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package. It's pronounced 'Pa-kojj.' Get outta here! You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry. Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea. Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait 48% of those are already in relationships and then you have to eliminate half for intelligence, sense of humor and compatibility and then you have to take out the ex-girlfriends and the relatives and oh, we can't forget those lesbians and then that leaves us with 8 women. That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight? There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door. Do you take credit cards? BAR OK, it's back and this time we got a good look. Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that. It's bigger now. It's been feeding. We were just upstairs watching TV. Ah gosh. OK, let's do this. Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over. So did you get a good look at it? Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach... But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail. So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse? It's a cockamouse. What? It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know... Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha? That's impossible. That simply can't happen. Oh, but it can. And it has And it's pissed. Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open. There was no time. So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life? She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried? Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it. Did you just use my name as a verb? Billy Tedded up when OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days. LOVE SOLUTIONS OFFICE Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted. Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer. You said it was gonna be three days. Did I? Hm. Three days? Really? Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so... How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK. There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8. I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are. But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect. How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay. Well, I'm not. A little bi maybe? No. You're messing with me, right? Come see for yourself. I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6... There's a 9.6 right there. Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you. What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating? 8.5. So he sucks. No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient. Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6? Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day. BAR He's a whole new species. The cockamouse. And it's the size of a potato. So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse? Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse. My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch. She wants to have two children. Her guilty pleasure song is Summer Breeze by Seals and Croft. Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman. And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic. Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery. For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know. Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking. So you really don't believe in the cockamouse? Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster. If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster. It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese... OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin. You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny. All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that? That's right, I did the math. DOCTOR'S OFFICE Hi. Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien. I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too. Hi, I'm Ted. So, what are we doing today? I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy. I'm exactly the same. Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind. Blowing through the jasmine in my mind. Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song. Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch. I love brunch. It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies. I like the way you think, Architect Mosby. Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night? Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday. Friday night? Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here? Only a little. Well, by some million to one shot, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call. OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress. I'm sure you do. APARTMENT Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it? OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe. Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot. Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit. Aliens. Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place. You can't be serious. My friend, you just poked the bear. So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged. Oh. Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. Yeah, it was a long shot. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know... Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman. Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game. On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico. Oh geez. Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien. What? When suddenly, an array of Ted, hi, this is Dr. O'Brien. About today, listen, I really need to talk to you. Call me, I'll be at the office all day. The doctor will see you now. What should I do? I should totally go down there, right? Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday. Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so. In that scenario, I'm not interfering, I'm a happy ending. Happy ending. Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a shot. All right, see you later. Happy hunting. Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse. Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles. Oh my God! Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it? Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive. Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just beat it to death with a bat? DOCTOR'S OFFICE Hello again. I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person. Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything. You have a basal cell carcinoma. Anything else? Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it. Wait, then you're still getting married. Of course I'm still getting married. But we're a 9.6. Excuse me. OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5. You looked at my file. I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fiancé thinks we're a better match. I am getting married on Saturday. Summer breeze... Ted. Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago? Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know? See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other. Ted, just calm down. Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians. Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so. Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused. Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10. You're right. LAB If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career. Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold. You bastard, I actually got excited about this. What? It's empty. Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily. APARTMENT Robin. What? Oh my God. It's real. Oh, is it? Do something. What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk? It was the only think I could think of. Lily thank God. Lily, I love you. Robin, open the window! It can fly. Wow. Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private war of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way. LOVE SOLUTIONS OFFICE Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back. Although this transvestite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything. Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit cliché? It's for the bourbon. This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me. No, I won't. You're gonna die alone. I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking. No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder. You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days. No you won't. Yes I will I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I. You're losing me. Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen. So I should keep looking? Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free. LIVING ROOM So kids, there are many buildings New York City. EXT. NEW YORK CITY BUILDINGS Thousands of apartments. Millions of stories. And even though it's been decades and someone else lives there now, there's one apartment in particular that will always be our apartment. I have so many great memories of that place. EXT. APARTMENT Marshall playing video games. Lily painting on the fire escape. Hey! Sorry, Mr. Madsen. And me making the coffee. I had this coffeepot that was probably 50 years old at that time, and it made truly terrible coffee. We called it Shocky Plugging in. Saving game. I loved every last detail of that place. Right down to the incredibly tacky swords we hung on the wall. I never wanted any of it to change. But that's not how life works. You guys will never believe what just happened to us. I don't even believe it myself. We were in Queens and we decided to stop by my apartment. INT. LIVING ROOM, YEAR 2030 Wait, her apartment? I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall. EXT. STREET I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing. When was the last time you were there? Three months ago. What? It's like fat pants. You hope you never have to use 'em but you're glad to know they're there. What the hell? What? This is my apartment. Where? Right here. INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT What the hell? Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant. No, no, this was my apartment. My dresser was right... That's my dresser! And this is my closet. And I spilled nail polish there. There's the stain. Hi, how many? Lily. Yes, you know me? Yeah, from your homecoming picture. You're much prettier in person. Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake. This is my apartment! Not anymore. INT. APARTMENT No way. You're making this up. Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice. They sent you a notice about this. When? Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines. Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease. OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy. She may be 98 years old but she's still... She's dead, isn't she? Never even saw the bus. INT. APARTMENT My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do? Come live with us. Really? Of course. You sure about this, Ted? Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything. INT. BAR No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed. What? What are you talking about? And why is that girl checking you out? Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged Yeah, so? So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be? Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right? Yeah, we've talked about it. So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment? Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that? Who? Future Ted and Future Marshall. Totally. Let's let those guys handle it. Dammit Past Ted You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out. That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend. One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me. Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment. Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal? Sort of on a date with her. What? All right, Ted, call me from the hospital. All right. You're going to the hospital? No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital. Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney. Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck. So, are you gonna talk to Marshall? He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no. Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it. I should really make this call. Ooh, can I do it? Hi there, sexy. Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up? Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff. Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy. Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter? Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate. Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there. See you guys later. INT. APARTMENT Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup. Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great. What happened to Shocky? My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right? Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky. Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty. Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know. Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you. No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee. That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it. INT. BAR They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right. Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one. Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she! It's not just the coffeemaker. INT. APARTMENT Done. The painting's done. That is great. Nice. Where do you wanna hang it? I don't know. Um, over the piano? Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords. Well, those swords have been up there a long time. I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room? OK. INT. BAR He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that? Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend. One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication. Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike. Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do? You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big. What, like buy a new sofa? Bigger. Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law. A lemon law, like for cars. Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now. Hi Katie. Barney. Hi, it's good to finally meet you. Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history. Tell your friends. It's gonna be a thing. KITCHEN Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved "Ted" into that block of cheese. Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's. He's not cool with me moving in. No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you. So, what's he PMS'ing about? I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it. Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything. He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive. You clearly don't know Ted. Delivery for Ted Mosby. LIVING ROOM Your English phone booth arrived. Oh, awesome. It's great, right? Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it. Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool. Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them. Exactly. Great Terrific. You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall. Oh, so it's like that, is it? Bring, bring. Oh hello governor, oh it's like isn't it? Cheerio. Yeah, it's like that. I want this apartment. Well, I want it too. BAR You're a jerk. No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing! For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society. No, wrong, lemon law is awesome. It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great. OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy. You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two? Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate. Bad move, Scherbatsky. Hi, have you met Robin? Hi. Hi. INT. APARTMENT All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this. Or we could flip a coin. Yeah, let's flip a coin. Flip it. OK, I'm flipping it, here I go. Flip it. OK, here I go. Flip it. I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies. That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got? OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails. You don't need two rooms Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms? We might be starting a family soon. Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years. It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip. Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused. Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked. Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down. We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting? My fiancé...suddenly, she's my fiancé. Lily's a part of who I am. And if you're such a bro, she's a part of who you are too. She's a bro by extension. I deserve this apartment, Marshall. No more than I do. Great, so let's flip for it. Flip it. So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment? I guess so. How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death? We should probably figure that out. It's OK, it's OK. Can I observe something? That this is kinda awesome? Totally. I can't believe we didn't do this before. I know! INT. RESTAURANT Thank you. I can't believe this. I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet. It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs. In the future food will most likely be served in gel-cap form. Plus cows will probably have died out by then... or be our leaders. Just a second. Hello. Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law. Leave me alone. 58. We're only just getting to know each other. Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital. Sorry. Let me guess, there's been a crazy accident and you have to go. No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours. Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money. INT. APARTMENT That was awesome. I know. Do it again. OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs. Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair? Oh, boo-freakin-hoo. What? Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic. Anhedonic? Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything. The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this. I know, this rules. Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down. That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it? Yeah it did. You remember when we first got these swords? It was the day we moved in. Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall. List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table Just use this wood glue, it'll hold. Yeah. INT. RESTAURANT Oh God, I'll be right there. Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword. Hab slosi quch! You have no honor. You know, if you felt this way you could have just been upfront. No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it. INT. HOSPITAL WAITING AREA I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fiancé. But you fought so bravely for it. I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours. Is she OK? They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine. So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie. What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie. INT. BAR Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O. Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you. INT. HOSPITAL WAITNG ROOM It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law. But you're totally... Just let him have this one. All set. She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed round table? That's us. INT. EXAM ROOM A sword fight? Sorry, Lily. On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fiancé ran me through with a frickin' broad sword. Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through. I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me? You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won. Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you. Uh, you know, if I tried... Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place. Gonna miss the old place. I will too. We're not getting married for like a year. Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it. Totally. Maybe it's the massive blood loss talking but I'm starving. Let's go get some dinner. I know just the place. INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it. I told you. OK, a toast. Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff. Here here. Cheers And to the lemon law. Self-clink. And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses. I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever. I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year. Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings. I love you, Lily. Happy Valentine's Day 1998. INT. LIVING ROOM Kids, this is a Thanksgiving story. Thanksgiving in New York is a wonderful time. It's a time for giving of yourself, for thinking of your fellow man, a time when the unforgiving city becomes a little kinder. INT. APARTMENT Well, I just ralphed. How much did you guys drink last night? Not how much? What. The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth. You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan. The shuttle's here! He hasn't been back home to Minnesota since Christmas. He's a little excited. Baby, we're holding up the shuttle, do you have everything you need? Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants. Underpants. So, Lil, Marshall's family. Whole weekend with the future in-laws, you excited? Yeah, no, it'll be fun. Lily, you just said, "yeah, no." Did I? No, I-I love Marshall's family. Oh. But, yeah, no, it'll be great. You just did it again. Yeah, no, shut up. Wait, so you're not going home for Thanksgiving. No, I have to work on Friday. You? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October. Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, "oat" You guys are the world's leader in handgun violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue. Your cops are called Mounties. So, probably hanging out with Barney then? No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition. Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal. Oh, Barney. I'm sorry, Native American. I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food. That's awesome. Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good. Canceling out Barney. Exactly. Where are all my underpants? Did you check your suitcase? Let's go. And go they went, all the way to St. Cloud, Minnesota, Marshall's hometown. And as Lily stepped into her fiancé’s boyhood home, she received a big welcome. INT. ERIKSEN HOME Hello, we're home! A very big welcome. You see, at 6'4", Marshall was the runt of the Eriksen clan. Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are. Where's my almost daughter-in-law? Here I am. You got yourself a great little bride here, son. All right now, no farting around. Put your skates and your pads on, boys. Game on in five minutes. You're gonna go play hockey? With a basketball? Well, it's a combination of the two. We call it baskiceball. We invented it. It's the most dangerous and awesome sport in the world. Baskiceball? Not iceketball? Ice-ket-ball? Just sounds weird. Yeah. It's baskiceball, OK? And I'm the best. You wish. Oh, well maybe that's just 'cause you haven't seen me play. I don't know honey, it's not really a sport for a girl. Well, that's funny because your brother throws like a girl. Marcus! HOMELESS SHELTER KITCHEN This is gonna be great. I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York. Excuse me, guys. Coming through. Barney? Well, hi guys. What are you doing here? Oh, just the Lord's work. But you're Satan. Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys. This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here. Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done? I'm on it. Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this? Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall. Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do? Go home, we're full. What? We're volunteers, we're unpaid help. Can you really ever have enough unpaid help? On the biggest volunteer day of the year, yeah, you can. Come on, we just wanna help out. Kendall, they're cool. Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you. OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles. ERIKSEN'S KITCHEN Oh, I almost forgot. I know it's early but you are a future Mrs. Eriksen. Thank you. It'll go great with my...I just love it. OK, Lily, we're putting you on salad duty. Oh, I make this great frisée and endive salad with a coriander lime vinaigrette. But this is an American holiday. The Eriksen family seven-layer salad. Seven-layer salad? Six cups of mayonnaise? That can't be right. Oh no, dear, sixteen cups. Mayo's in that cabinet. Oh my God, there is some serious baskiceball going on out there. Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face with a snowball, which is a foul because you only get one snowball per possession, so I nailed him in the shin with my skate and I totally dunked it. Yeah, you were sitting pretty until I whacked you with that mallet. Hey Gorgeous! Yeah, but I kinda miss you. Could you stay in here for a little bit? Yeah, yeah yeah, no problem, it's halftime. Oh, halftime's over. Get yours butts out here, come on. And I hope you like the taste of stick, dorko. Go. Thanks baby. Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town? Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko! HOMELESS SHELTER KITCHEN Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today; I've got like a soul boner. And the way the faces of the less fortunate light up when you give them a hot, nutritious meal, is there a better feeling on earth? Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot. Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit? You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude. ERIKSEN KITCHEN OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next? Potato chips. So, Lily, when are you gonna start thinking about having a baby? Baby? Uh, you know, I hadn't really thought about it at all. Actually Aunt Lily was lying. It'd been all she'd been thinking about. You see, remember when she said... Well, I just ralphed. At that point she was five days late. This was day six. Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right? Oh, are you kidding? I was younger than you when I had Marcus. Beautiful 15-pound boy. Not much bigger than this turkey right here. Oh my. Now if Lily was already uneasy about joining the Eriksen family, imagine how she felt about possibly having a 15-pound Eriksen growing inside of her. That's a big baby, Judy. The doctor thought he was twins. Twins. Twins! HOMELESS SHELTER KITCHEN This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work? I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend. Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway? I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at. What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl... Have you met Ted? Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is... ... gone. I'm Amanda. Hi. So, what do you do here, Ted? Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing. If you want to do something, you and your girlfriend can help sort through these donations. Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God. So, Amanda, what do you need us to do? OK, this is important. Go through all these boxes of food donations, take out the really good stuff and put it into this box. Got it. Consider it sorted. Hey, we're in business. Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today. Let's start with this one. Yeah. ERIKSEN DINING AREA Amen. Amen. Look who came to say good-night. It's little Martin. Three-months old. Three months! Three months? He's been drinking his milk. Here here. And she's already pregnant again. Well, that's 'cause those Eriksen boys’ boys can swim. They've got two tails and a drill bit for a head. Dad, you're embarrassing me. Ah, son, she's cool. She's gonna be an Eriksen. Yeah, well, well, not literally because, you know, I'm keeping my name. But the apron. Well, we haven't actually decided anything yet so... No, I've decided and I'm keeping my own name. But Eriksen is a great last name. People know the Eriksen's. Oh, sure, in St. Cloud but our kids aren't gonna be growing up in St. Cloud. Right, baby? Why not St. Cloud? I mean, I loved growing up St. Cloud. St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood. Oh, so is New York. What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped. HOMELESS SHELTER KITCHEN Hey, Amanda, what's this box for? Oh, that's for me. You can put it in my car. In your car, um, then you'll take it... Home? We get so much extra food, no one can eat it all. Oh, Truffle oil. Score. People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry. I know, and I'm starving. INT. ERIKSEN DINING ROOM But, Marshall, you love New York. Yes, I do. But you always said that when we had kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan. Yeah, to Brooklyn. Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road. But Lily knew way down the road might not be so far down the road. I need to go to the restroom. Lily, the restroom's the other way. So she headed down the road. Lily. Lily! HOMELESS SHELTER KITCHEN So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn. Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right? Yeah, Right. Thanks. Barney. Yeah, what's up? You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet. Yeah, so. All right, let me see that. That's my private personal business! Court-mandated community service. Oh my God, you're on probation? What did you do? That's my private personal business. I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church. You peed on a church? I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk. Oh, you are evil. Now, all's right with the world again. OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW. When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh? Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people. Amanda! I called dibs on the Portobello mushrooms. Those are for the hungry. I know, and I'm starving. Those are good mushrooms! INT. HOMELESS SHELTER DINING AREA Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive! CONVENIENCE STORE Happy Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Eriksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me. You know the Eriksen's? Marshall's fiancée. Fantastic. So nice to meet you. You are taller than described. I'm sorry I just yelled at you. You mind if I use your bathroom? Don't have one. So what do you do when you have to...? I hold it. STREET You can't fire a volunteer. Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends. I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip. Volunteer of the year! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it. Ted, I'm glad you asked. LUSTY LEOPARD Surprisingly good. Right? I told you so. Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination? ERIKSEN DINING ROOM Lily's been arrested. Oh dear, what for? Public urination. INT. JAIL CELL Thanks, Pete. No problemo, Marsh. You all right? No. I embarrassed myself in front of your family and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever. LUSTY LEOPARD JAIL CELL Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store? OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise. Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just... Just promise. Why do you want me to promise you that? Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it. I'm Funyuns…and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving? OK, personal effects, one wallet, one cell phone, one pregnancy test. Pete arrested me before I could look at it. Whoa. Yeah. Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous. Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? There are no rules, we just wail on each other. Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either. We'll be our own family, and we'll find our own way to freak out the people our kids bring home. Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father. Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood. What does it say? I'm afraid to look. It's negative. Thank God. And hey! LUSTY LEOPARD Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy. You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer. OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance. Are you joking? I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment. No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet. No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine. Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance. You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes. You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.  Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you so much. No really, thank you. Happy Thanksgiving, guys. Thanksgiving in November. Weird. So that was Thanksgiving 2005. To be honest, it didn't go great. But life has plenty of good parts. It's the rough parts that make you thankful that you have people to share it with. INT. LUSTY LEOPARD Hey, I saw what you did for that guy? It was really sweet. Do you wanna dance? Uh, no thanks. You want some yams? No thanks. I'm Amber. I'm Ted. Actually, I'm Tracy. Still Ted. And that, kids, is the true story of how I met your mother. LIVING ROOM What?! I'm kidding. Now I remember a lot of stories from back in the days before I met your mother, but there's one story I don't remember. Uncle Marshall still refers to it as the pineapple incident. The night started like any other. We were downstairs at the bar. INT. MACLAREN'S On the house. Whoa. It's my own concoction. I call it the Red Dragon. Wow. Thanks, Carl. We're not really doing shots, are we? I hope not. No, no. These look kinda like blood. OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire? That's ridiculous. I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark. Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender. Well, I should go get dressed. Where are you going, buddy? Hot date? I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire. Lily, I told you not to call him that. Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire? He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up? So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you? A charity dinner. Yeah, $2000 a plate. $1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger. You gonna put out? What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills. I think my soul just threw up a little bit. Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye. See ya. Bye. You OK? Sure, why? I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire. OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for... What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go. Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line? Daddy's home. Daddy's home? Yeah. You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney. Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid. OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it? Garlic fries. OK, well, I'll get back to you. Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that... Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh? That worked. I hate the world. Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do. Doo-doo. Totally. So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped. Oh yes it can. Interesting Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style. So, what? You want me to do a shot. Oh no. I want you to do five shots. Oooh, more interesting. Barney, I think you've officially... No, don't think. Do. Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink. Drink, drink, drink, drink... Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being? Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink... Yes! Drink, drink, drink... Let me tell you something about this brain, OK? Drink! Drink, drink... Even alcohol cannot stop this brain. I love it, I love it, I love it. Drink, drink, drink... This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain. Drink, drink, drink, drink... This is a superbrain. This brain is unstoppable. This brain... And that's all I remember, except for a few hazy memories. But really, the next thing I remember is waking up the following morning. INT. TED'S BEDROOM So, there were some unanswered questions. How much did I drink? How did I sprain my ankle? And who was this girl in my bed? INT. APARTMENT There's our rock star OK, what the hell happened last night? You really don't remember, Superbrain? So, Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily filled me in. And how did you guys like the shots? I drank all five, bitch. I love drunk Ted. Marshall thinks you're a vampire. If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up. No dibs. Oh. No....Dammit. How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny. Who are you calling? Robin. Oh, bad idea. No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober. Says every girl you've ever slept with. Say what?! Hello Robin, it's Ted. Oh hi Ted. Hello Robin, it's Ted. Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun. Ted on phone) Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three? Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right ... '93? Dude, that's impressive. I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes. That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now. Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow. Bye Ted. Slow. Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots. Friends don't let friends drink and dial. I need that phone back. You'll get this back at the end of class. Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want. Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom. Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out. Cheap Trick? Oh Ted. Hello again, Ted. Hey, it's me again. Plain to see again. Please can I see you every day? I love everyone in this bar. And we love you, drunk Ted. I'm a fool again. I fell in love... Ted? Well, that explains the ankle. And then we brought you home and put you to bed. Was there anyone else in there with me? There's a girl in there. I know. And a pineapple. I know. Who is she? I don't know. Whoa. I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened. Hello. Why are you sleeping in our tub? The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling. Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night? Don't worry, I slept through it.  I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big tank. How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one. Oh, you put Ted to bed all right. You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much. Good night, Ted. Love you too, buddy. I'm back baby doll! Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now. All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one? I think.... Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride. Bring it. Have you met Ted? Excuse me. You're calling Robin. I'm calling Robin. Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her. Oh yeah? What you gonna do? If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire. You're bluffing. Hello, Robin, it's Ted. Ted, for the last time, stop. Ted! You set me on fire. Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend. You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed? There's a girl in your bed. And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple? Who is she? I have no idea. Nice. You really don't know who that is? No, after I hosed you down with a beverage gun, I brought you back here. I better not have gotten burned. Did any of you write that? Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that? I don't know. Dude, call it. Hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn. OK, you can call now. God, this is intense, I love it. Hello. Uh, hi, who is this? You called me, who's this? It's Ted. INT. MACLAREN'S It's Carl, from the bar. INT. APARTMENT And then Carl filled us in. Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer. Sleep it off, bra. And I am gonna throw up. I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on. I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted. Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we? Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now. Give me your arm. This way, if you pass out in the gutter... That tickles. Someone will call me and I will come get you. Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it. Excuse me? Me and Robin. Me and Robin, I have to make one more call. Yeah, this'll go good. Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great. Thanks Carl. It's Robin. That's Robin in there. Did you guys? Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on. All right, right over here. Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it... Someone get him a shot, he's thinking again. Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad. You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up. Wake her up and say what? Daddy's home. Good luck buddy. INT. TED'S BEDROOM Hello. Ted, it's Robin. Are you sure? INT. APARTMENT Hey, Robin, how are you? Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by? Ask her about the pineapple. Yeah, sure, come on over. Thanks. No, wait, don't, no. She's coming over. Crap. Wait, this is killing me. We have to find out who that girl is. Trudy. My name is Trudy. And then Trudy filled us in. I'm just surprised you didn't dump him sooner. I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see. Daddy's home. Or the one after that. OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy. Ladies. I love everyone in this bar. Look at that idiot go. He's kinda cute. What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up. Did you? I did not. And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93. Sorry, Trudy, go on. I liked your performance. What? The karaoke? Domo arigato. I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself. Do it. I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid. I'm something stupid, do me. You're funny. OK. Here, let me. Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra. That's hauntingly beautiful. Hey, it works. Then I guess you're gonna have to call me. I need to make one more call. Hello. Hey, it's me again. Hey. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life. So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed. Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry. Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom. Why, is that your girlfriend? No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated. You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this. No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide. Hi. Hey guys. Robin. Hi Robin. Top of the morning. Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk. No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk. Let's go get a snack. I love to snack. I'm good. Come on, those calls weren't that weird. Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out. That goes on for three-and a half minutes. Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record. Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing. No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on. Really, you moved on? Yes. What, you don't believe me? Oh, OK. Trudy, come on out. You are gonna laugh. Yeah, Trudy, she's cool. Trudy, come on out. Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think. Trudy? INT. TED'S BEDROOM Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy. I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape. Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think. Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes? Yes, you did, last night. Really? Well. Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse. I left Trudy a message but she never called me back. That's just how life works sometimes. You turn off your brain for a night, and all you're left with is a bad hangover, a sprained ankle. INT. APARTMENT Oh, and we never found out where that pineapple came from, but it was delicious. Yeah, that's right...a limo. Oh, man, Ted, this is great. Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five. Question? Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants. But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants. Yeah. We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year. All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth? Mary Beth? Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight... People often ask me "Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?" By who ? Who asks you that? And the answer is right here... my own, personal "get psyched" mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam. It's working. I am definitely getting psyched. Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot. Let's do this! Yes! Let's! Oh, driver? Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome. I've moved up in the world. How do you guys know each other? Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story. Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it. Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up. Oh, yeah, Robin was spending New Year's with her boyfriend, Derek. Derek. He was like rich, successful, handsome. I hated that guy. Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun. Bye. See ya next year. Go get 'em. Well, this kind of sucks. Okay, nobody get down.  We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one. Party number one! Party number one! I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can beat that, you got some brass ones. Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it. We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall. Hi. Mary Beth. So great to meet you guys. My word. You're, you're friendly. American party friends of Barney's. Oh, no. So, Barney, who's your new friend? Natalya. Oh, friendly. So, where are you from, Natalya? She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan? Super-drunk-fantastic, huh? Isn't she awesome? How are your feet doing, baby? Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change? Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain. Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking. It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock? Ranjit! Party number two. Party number two. Party number two? Not so good. Let's go back to party number one. No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three. Party number three. Yeah. Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya. Barney, none of us really liked her. What?! Sorry. Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up? I'm sorry about Barney. No, I'm having a great time. I'm really glad that you asked me out tonight. Me, too.  Hey, Robin. Ted, Derek stood me up. Pfft. Derek.  Now, we had a tight schedule to keep that night and I was already on a date with another girl. But... it was Robin. Ranjit, turn it around. Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up. No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together. What happened? Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks. Oh, dude, not now! What? She needs to get psyched. Fine. Maybe I should just go home. My finger slipped. Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve.  Look, so your date fell through. So what ? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at...  a little bit after midnight. Hi, I'm Robin. Mary Beth. You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing? That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya! Oh, yes. Ted, you rock. We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs? Yeah, we like hot dogs. No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit. You don't know what you're missing. Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour. Which is exactly how much time I need. Ranjit, stop the car. Stopping the car. Wait. Baby, what are you doing? I'm going home. What? No! I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't. There's a cab over there. I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes. But... hot dogs. Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one. Okay, I'll go with you. No, baby. Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at... party number three. Are you sure? If I don't see you, happy new year. Don't say that. We'll find each other. We'll find each other. I know we will. Hell of a woman. Let's go get some hot dogs! Ranjit, party number three. Party number three. Oh, yeah! Look at us. Riding around in a limo. Eating hot dogs. It's like we're the president. Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now. Oh, so much better. Guys. Is that Moby? I think that that's Moby. Now, kids, Moby was a popular recording artist when I was young. No way. That's totally Moby. That's awesome. Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby! Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool. Hey. Hello. What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere? Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown. You want a ride? Sure. Welcome. Wow. You're friendly. Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party? It's just a New Year's thing. You know, with some friends. Wow, that sounds awesome. You guys want to come? Yeah, we'd love to. All right. Uh, Ted. Sidebar? Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up? What about Lily? Call her. I've been trying to call her. I can't get through. All the circuits are jammed. That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards... No, I-I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta... I gotta find her. Okay, I'll meet you at party number three. But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party. Moby's party. This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise. Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it. Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here. Jan... Aah! So then I say, "your motorcycle was like that when I got here." You're not Moby, are you? Who? Moby... the recording artist, Moby. No. But when we said, "Hey, Moby," you said, "Yeah." I thought you said "Tony." So your name is Tony? No. Oh, hey, we're here. All right. You guys going to come in? Nah. You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money. No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby. Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe. Why did we think that guy was Moby? I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby. That's Marshall's phone. Hello. Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through. Hey, sexy. Barney, where's Marshall? He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you. What? Where? Party number three. Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby! Moby?! She's upstairs. Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby. Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a gun? Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds? Who was that guy?! Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony. Ranjit, drive! Where to? Party number three! Party number three! No, but I was just at party number three. No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong. Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my "Get Psyched" mix! Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule. Ah, nuts. Ranjit, are you sure I can't help? No. I am pissed. Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed. Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time. I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed. Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere. Is this just 'cause you lost your "Get Psyched" mix? I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side? I'm going to get some air. It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff. Ted, I'm going to head out. My roommates are having a party not far from here. No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but... How long have you been in love with Robin? I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from? Ted, it's okay. I'm fine. And I can tell that she's into you, too. That's ridiculous. Wait. Really? Happy New Year, Ted. I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight. Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal. The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am. Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here. I'm going to call Marshall. But he left his phone. Marshall! Marshall! I'm sorry about your girl. Sorry about your guy. Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight. Did you forget about our little deal? Because I did not. I did not, too. Derek. Hi. How's work? I'll give you some privacy. Marshall! 45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time. Marshall! Give it a rest, Ted. Give what a rest? Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year. Marshall! Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes. Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist. Marshall! Lily! Holy crap. Marshall! I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually. So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked... I walked to the next party on the list. Not Moby's party? Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on. Come on! Oh! Oh! Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me? I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there. How? We'll never get a cab. The flat's fixed. Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go! Natalya? Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to awake her. She looked so peaceful. Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town. Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes? I get you there in six. I don't think I can do it. No! Come on! Move, you stupid taxi! Three minutes! Come on! Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here. Cheers. Well said. Cheers. And just like that, we were having the perfect New Year's Eve. The funny thing is all night long, I'd been trying to chase something down that was right there in that limo. Derek?! Derek. Hey. Hey, uh, come on in. I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight. I can't believe you made it. I made it, baby. I super love you, okay? Here, you need a mint. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year! You probably want to feel bad for your old man at this point in the story. Well, don't. Not every night has a happy ending. But all of it's important. All of it was leading somewhere. Because suddenly, it was 2006. And 2006 was a big one. What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal. What about your guy? It's midnight. Go kiss him. Eh, he kept me waiting. I can keep him waiting. Well, a deal is a deal. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. When you're single and your friends start to get married, every wedding invitation presents a strange moment of self-evaluation. Will you be bringing a guest or will you be attending alone? What it's really asking is where do you see yourself in three months? Sitting next to your girlfriend or hitting on a bridesmaid? I always checked that I was bringing a guest. I was an optimist. Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding? For the most part, yeah. You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date. Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for? Ted, it's a simile. Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who? Robin. The big unanswered question in my life. Problem was, she was dating this really rich guy named Derek. Pft, Derek. INT. MACLAREN'S Well, Derek and I just broke up. No, that's terrible, are you OK? Yeah, do you need a drink or something? Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed. Don't beat yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you. Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now. OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing. Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave. Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits. No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact. Robin was into me when we first met. Fact. Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact. On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact. I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way. This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up. Ah, here we go. What? We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame. Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments. I thought so. You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes. I've been dreaming about this day since I was like... A little girl? What up? OK, I'm just saying, that it's my wedding too and I should have a say in it. Yes, but I'm the bride so I win. Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together. Right. But I'm the bride, so I win. Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years. You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one. Well, makes sense. So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'? Fine. You wanna be my date? Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here? Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game. Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap. Lily, I need a dress. You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress? I know, it's a suicide mission. Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it. Bye babe. Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership. Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday? Invigorating, thanks. OK, I wasn't going to say it in front of the guys but back then I really thought that's how it worked. You put yourself and a girl you like in some romantic setting. The stars line up and shazam. I know now that life is never that simple. EXT. STREET Hey, Claudia! Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla. You wrote it down wrong? No no no no no, listen to me. If I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian vanilla, I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground. Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding? Good-bye. My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going. Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited. You should be, lots of single girls. Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market. I'm bringing a date. You're not bringing a date. Uh, yes I am. Uh, no you're not. I checked 'plus one'. No you didn't. Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked... Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding. But I already invited someone. You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months! But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'. You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it? She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name. What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes? Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person? Don't make me hurt you Ted. INT. MACLAREN'S I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy. But to be fair, she's also hot. I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did. Yeah, right. I did. Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain? Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech. Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move... A little Barney. A little Barney. And you know what he said?  "Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney." Wow. Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her... Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about. Then what am I gonna do? The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come. INT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT BUILDING Just a second. Hey. Hey, listen. Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down. Lily's there's a problem. Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress. Go. INT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it? I think I brought it. Wow. That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun. Yeah, about that. I'll pick you up at five. INT. CAB So, the dress? I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding. What? I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card. Why didn't you check 'plus... I did check 'plus one'. But Robin is so excited. I know. And the dress. I know. Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in. We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas. I wish we were ninjas. I know. You can always ask Stuart. Can I do that? Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too. Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell. INT. STUART'S APARTMENT Dude, no problem whatsoever. Sure, the more the merrier. Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said... Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, this morning at the rehearsal, Claudia called our 7-year-old flower girl a whore. So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed. Yeah, she's not usually like that. No. Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding. INT. APARTMENT Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods. Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels. Squirrels don't get married, Marshall. Like you could possibly know that. I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding. Nice. What? How? I talked to Stuart. Oh, you went around the bride. "Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight." Did you known about this? It may have been my idea. What? Stuart doesn't get a say. Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say. Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes. So I can invite whoever I want. Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods. It's Claudia. So, it begins. Come on, it can't be that bad. Here, Lily, you answer it. What? Why? Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me. But...but you're the guy...oh. Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What? Now I wasn't there, but what I heard, it went something like this. Uh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding. You what? I told him he could bring a date to the wedding. Always undermining me at every turn. Try to show a little flexibility, but no, it's all about you. And your mother, calling me all the time... You know what, the wedding's off. They broke up. Ow! Uh-huh, uh-huh. It's not because of me, is it? Uh-huh. My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill Ted, then I'm gonna kill Ted. It's Robin. Answer it. Uh, Lily's phone. Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought. Uh, Lily's busy. Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them. That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye. Bye-bye. Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me? Ted, focus. Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk? I wanna go somewhere and drink. OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there. I feel terrible. Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart. Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me? She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000. Let's say we get these crazy kids back together. INT. MACLAREN'S Stuart and I just broke up. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries. You remembered I drink vodka cranberries. Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget? They all drink vodka cranberries. So, is there anything else you need, sweetie? You got $400,000? No, but I do have a hug. Thank you. INT. STUART'S APARTMENT Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way... Ted, for all I know you did me the biggest favor anyone's every done me. Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that. Yeah, I do. This whole thing's made me realize, I miss being single. I miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up. I miss owning porn. Dude, who doesn't. You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, "why am I with Claudia? I can be with her." That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both... The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy. Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes. Relationships aren't easy, they're hard work. It's about compromise, growing together, all that Dr. Phil crap. How would you know, you're not even married? OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall. Stuart, don't get married. Dude. What? I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry. You know I don't have $400,000, right? INT. MACLAREN'S Maybe we got together too young. Maybe that's what the problem was. I mean, I'm 28 years old. I've really only been with one man. That's just, that's ...  two more vodka cranberries please. Claudia, it's all gonna be OK. Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me. Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle. Oh, hell no. Oww Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes. One of each. All right, all right. Claudia. Stuart. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry too. I love you. I love you too, babe. Marshall and Ted set me straight, and when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize... Marshall said what? He made me realize how much I love you. These guys got us back together. So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing? It took three more vodka cranberries to subdue Claudia but eventually she graciously agreed to let me bring Robin. INT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT BUILDING Still wow. Wow yourself. Look who else brought it. INT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it. Sorry. They want me to anchor the news tonight. Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh. Do it. Do it. OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab... INT. WEDDING RECEPTION So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing. I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good. Crab puffs were incredible. We should totally have them at our wedding. Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something. Did we just start planning our wedding? I think we did. We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce. Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome. My God, were you born without taste buds? What? I love you. Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break. Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen. What's a sixteen? Those two eight's right over there. Yeah. Hi Ted. Claudia. We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship. Yeah, where is she? Um  She couldn't make it. Plan a wedding, you'll see. Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy. Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids. By the way, I almost forgot. We found this. Of course I was right. I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single. Being single's the best. Stay out as late as you want. Answer to no one. The whole world full of endless possibilities. Never having to go to a farmer's market. OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me... So there we were, two single guys doing our usual single guy thing. For whatever reason, I had let myself believe that this night would be a turning point, that this was the night that my life, my real life, would finally begin. Funny thing is, I wasn't totally wrong. (Ted notices girl at table, Girl looks at Ted and smiles 'Cause that night was just beginning. Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments, and they make life worth living. But here's the problem, moments pass, and lurking just around the corner from those moments is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality. INT. WEDDING RECEPTION And so, back in 2006, on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding, reality was the enemy. Wow, the Peace Corps? Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, "Is it?" And usually they say, "yes it is." Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do. Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that. This wasn't how I thought the night would turn out. This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin. But then reality came along. Robin got called up last minute to anchor the 11 o'clock news. It was her big break. And I went to the wedding stag. Then, when I least expected it... INT. APARTMENT Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night? I had the most amazing night ever. Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley. Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake... Say what? Lily. Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go. I should tell you, I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings. I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule. Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real. Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt. You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee. Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage. Wedding goggles. Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you. This isn't the moves? What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves. That's too bad. Tell me about it. You know, I think I have a solution. Interested. And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight. Less interested. Go ahead. OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out. What are you saying? I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again. Unless... No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect. Wow. OK, I'm in. OK. I guess, what, we'll need fake names? Um, you can call me Buttercup. Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian. Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded... Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted. So, I'm Ted. Victoria. But no last names. No last names. Oh. Oh, what is wrong with you? Dude, that is just like ... a weenie ass idea. No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it. Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake. That cake really got to you, huh? It haunts me. So, what happened next? OK, ground rules have been established. Mm-hm. Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about. Wait wait wait wait wait. Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet. Yes, but we'll need a diversion. Kiss. Go. Go, go, go So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition. You're not gonna do it at your wedding? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do. So, where did you guys go? Very nice. Yeah? OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance. I couldn't really tell. Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight. Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some. No you couldn't. You're a dude. I could totally... Totally get some. We're not gonna kiss tonight. If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken. I will use exactly the right amount of tongue. OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll. OK. But we can't kiss. OK. A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo? Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing. She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again. Dammit, I have to see her again. Yes. So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her? Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know. Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then. Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now. No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon. Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake. INT. AIRPORT Ted? Hey, Claudia, great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff. How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl and I was wondering if you had... Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me. Oh, here we go. 24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her? I've moved on. What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes. Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name. Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards. Thank God. Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted. INT. APARTMENT There was no Victoria at the wedding. Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good. Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay. Marshall. She was not a ghost. I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form. Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was? Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids? INT. MASSAGE PARLOR This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what? Barney. Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste. Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number? You know I did. Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me. You know I won't. Why not? INT. MACLAREN'S Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India. Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause. Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night. OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing. Yeah. But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing. I'm ready to be proven wrong. Tonight. Dial. Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on. What kind of shoes ... Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing. Actually. Oh come on. Hey. So, what do you want to do next? Uh... Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind. Hold this. Whoa. There she goes. Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them. Yeah, they do sound cute. Any idea who...? OK, well thanks anyway. Yeah, you take... Tonight? Well, I'm shipping out pretty early so I won't be able to stay over, but, yeah, sure, I'd love to. OK, I'll talk to you later. Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight. I understand. OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori... Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor. No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers. Agreed. And I thought that was the end of it, but then... INT. APARTMENT Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it? Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin. Congrats, that's so cool. Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though. Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact... And then Lily told her the whole story, right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them, and by the end of it... What? I know who she is. You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding. Actually, I kind of was. What? Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception. Dammit. Stop it. What the hell? Hello? You OK in there? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine. Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger. Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry? Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying? Because you have feelings for Ted. I don't know, maybe. OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult. Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel. Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel. Kinda, yeah. But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still ... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy. Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy. I'm gonna go find him. Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him? I have no idea. INT. MACLAREN'S And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex. I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately. Hi, guys, Hey. Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second? Sure. What's up? Uh, I, I have to tell you something. Oh. Oh, just get it. Hello. Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you. Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?! Sweet pea. Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person. It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it. Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake. Cake. Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it. Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom? We got it at this little bakery downtown. Actually, neither. It's called the Buttercup Bakery. Pleased to meet you , Buttercup. I made the cake. She made the cake. Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake. She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us. I'm going down to that bakery. No, no, don't do it. Baby, what are you talking about?! Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl. Yes. Ted. Go get her. Going. Getting. Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up! Yes! No. Oh come on! Whoa. Guess we were gone a while. Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance. Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking. Wow, what was I thinking? Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux. You got me, you are good. You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it. The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it. INT. CAB Buttercup Bakery. This is it. Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake. Ted, you still with us? Tell me your last name. You know, there's one little flaw in our plan. What's that? the memory of you walking out that door. Hey, Ted. Yeah? Close your eyes, and count to five. One, two, three, four, five. And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be... The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot. OK. INT. BUTTERCUP BAKERY Oh thank God. The appartment They have to come out soon, it's Monday. Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned. Maybe they're not even in there. Good morning. Hey, guys. I'm just going to ignore that. Thank you! I wish you could stay. I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting. Call you afterwards? I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye. Bye. Two days straight?! Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage! Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits. Zero. What? What? Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow. Her idea. Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on. The Bar I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda. I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that. You've only had sex with one girl in your whole life. Burn! Ted, the only reason to wait a month for sex is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old. I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out? Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner. No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary. Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats. Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest. It's one of New York Magazine's "Top five romantic getaways on a budget." Who says sexual can't be sensible? Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me. Really? Actually, I was talking to my martini. The appartment Ready to go? Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast. 00 A.M. ...Sharp. Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese. Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce. Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive. And it's supposed to rain tonight. Or we could just stay home. Maybe watch some TV. Order in some Chinese. Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing? Hell, yeah. Good, cause this thing's empty. The Bar Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say "wow." Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident. It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship. Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror? You can't just... Wow! Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go. I need a "bro" for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro? Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in. In a cab So... one more week and it'll be a month. Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me. Oh, come on. The 18th can't get here fast enough. Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th! Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this. Yeah. Or we could do it tonight. 75th and Amsterdam. In the bathroom I'm  so glad we decided to just stay home. Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky. And yet we'd feel obligated to have sex. Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever. I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend. I'm so glad your roommates are out of town. Oh, my God, what are they doing home? They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted. But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom. They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom. But I don't want to hide out in here. Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have sex with Ted, and... not going to be me. Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss. In a bar You suited up! Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right. Emilio? The woman will have... I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks. Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. "The Torpedo." Or, as the rollers call it, "Piramide." My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention. Father issues. Hot. I know... I was this close to being a huge slut. Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl. Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have sex to get pregnant. What up! Freeze frame high five! The appartment I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever. No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious. Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad. And they're not even high. It's actually working. Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had sex three times by now. Yeah, try five. What up! Maybe we should just go out there. No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird. Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh. I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry? Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl. In a bar So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar? Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still... What? There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it. At Laser-Tag Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed! Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months. Oh, I believe it... this is awesome! Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you? Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere. The appartment He's just staring into her eyes. I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us. Yeah...  now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life. No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom. Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This  is their first time. Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, "Want to do it?" And I say, "Yeah." Want to... No! Maybe we're just out of firsts. Looks like they're about to have theirs. Should we take this to the bedroom? Yes! Yes! Yes. Yes! Yes! No. No, don't answer it! You can answer it. We have all night. You're answering it? He's answering it! No! Do her! Do her now! Sure. Good luck with that.  Sorry about that. How about a little more wine? I'll get another bottle. I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here? Shh... At Laser-Tag Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it. No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does. But I... Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky. See you on the other side. Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel? Yeah. All right. The appartment Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that? Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes. Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it. It's all right. We can do this. Let's just hold hands. This is nice. You love that move. It's a classic Marshall. All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here. Well, we can't. Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship. What is it? I have to pee. This is bad. Yeah. We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time. Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever. How much longer do you think you can hold it? I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon. Oh,  boy. The Bar Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game. Neither have I. Of course I cheat. Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L. Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other. Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox. Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt. That's a woman. Oh, my mistake. Or is it? Let's just focus on your target. Right. Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans. Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just... Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get. Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans. Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him. We'll see about that. The appartment Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much. Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other. No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive. Well, you have farted in front of me. Yes, but I always cover it with a cough. You always do. The Bar Hey. Hey. Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else. What happened? Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release. But why? Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores. Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship? Hit! The appartment Ted, I can't wait any longer. Should we move to the bedroom? There's no time for that. They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom? Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time. I know. I love you, Marshall. I love you, Lily. In front of Robin's appartment You know, Barney, I had a surprisingly good time bro-ing out tonight. Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake. Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys. Hard-core? That's the only way I play. I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing? I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me? No!  I thought we were just hanging out as friends. Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night. What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you. You invited me up to your apartment to "play Battleship." Is that not an internationally recognized term for sex? No. Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship. The appartment I'm okay. You okay? I feel the same. And yet, strangely different. I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us. You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted.  And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes. Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap! They must have heard that. Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone. Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz. At Robin's Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second... But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well. Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted? I checked with Ted. Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right? Sure. Good luck with that. Totally gave us his blessing. Really? Really. So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me? Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh... What? You like Ted. I didn't say I liked Ted. You like Ted. Wow. This is huge. Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for... Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what? You're not gonna tell him, are you? No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro. A-7. Miss. Of course. The appartment Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce. Not making me feel better. Well, it certainly was a first. It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts. Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Marshall, what makes you cry? This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment. Oh, just grab my boob already. Come on, guys, get a room. You don't have to shout out "poker" when you win. I know. It's just fun to say. We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights instead of playing in them. Which he took to mean, "invent your own game." The Bar It's called "Marsh-gammon." It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary. Backgammon, obviously. No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the "gammon," and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs. I'm so excited Victoria's coming. I'm going to go get another round. Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the... Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return. No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that. Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return? Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria? Us? What would we do? Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight? Fine. Fine. Thank you. I should go help Robin. Hey. Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight? Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, "She's great" too many times, didn't I? You must really hate the bitch. The appartment But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you "Marshall out," and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question "What?", then... you got to drink. Got it? No Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll. Okay. Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on. Marshall, come on. Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, "Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?" Wow, good question. You don't have to answer that. It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up. Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains. So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy? What? You said what, you got to drink! Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon? Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon. Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give... Where's the tape? Fine. I'll go get it. Cool, okay. You know, whenever. Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria! Of course. Victoria, "How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?" Wait, the card actually says "Ted?" Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two. Prude alert. Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between. Oh, slut alert! Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me. Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon. Barney, what was on that tape? Too bad you'll never find out. Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did. What?! Drink! Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in? Give it to me, give it, give me... Play the tape, play it, play it! Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's... The Bar Did you try his cell phone? Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid. Hey, guys, what up? Barney, where have you been? Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that. Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay. Come on. Stay! I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me. Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it. Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is. All right. I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants. The kids still call him Funny Butt. Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today. It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend...  Thank you. All right. I love your singing, Barney. And I love you, Shannon. Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary. I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua. Hey, nonfat latte to go. Mellow order, bro, mellow order. Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five! Sorry, I only give high twos. Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that. Listen to you. That? You know, wo Kids, when it comes to love, the best relationships are the ones that just come naturally. My first solo batch. Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage. Yeah, well, things with Victoria were fun, and easy, and uncomplicated. It was pretty great. Um, are you coloring in your butt? I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt. So wear another one. I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday. Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door. Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for...  their bosses are going to save the world. Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor. A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding. Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks "suit." Tomorrow, noon, my tailor. No thanks, dude.  Noon? Noon. See you then. The Bar Hey, girls. Hey. Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner. Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask. Robin! Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship. Really? Oh. Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again. What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount. Really? That'd be great. Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello. Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster? Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them? The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes. Sold. Victoria, what's wrong? I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany. The Bar Wait. Germany, Europe? It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in. So, this is the Europe Germany? What other Germany would it be? The one in Epcot? Ted. Sorry. Congratulations. Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go. Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us? I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone. Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college. So, that leaves us with... Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel... I have to leave on Monday. Monday, September the...? Ted. Do you have any thoughts? Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it. It's a date. And that's when things got complicated. Marshall is At Barney's tailor / Lily is shopping for her wedding dress with Victoria and Robin Hey, baby, how's the dress place? Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor? Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind. Well, good luck, baby. Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store? Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process. You speak Ukrainian? Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option. No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no sex. Kill me now. Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work. Really? You? Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from Killarney. Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris? Yeah. Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, "You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face." Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am. Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point? Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost killed us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay. Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be. Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling. Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people. Are you sure? All right. Hello. Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats? Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal. Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye.  She's a cat person. I don't know this girl at all. Oh, excellent. We'll take this one. Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose? Here. Play with this pin cushion. God. I'm going to look hot. Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot. No way.  The Kid does not sell out. Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year. No. I've made my decision. So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go. In a restaurant And so I met her that night to tell her my decision. All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking. I want you to stay. At the Tailor / At the wedding shop Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind. Oh, good luck, baby. Bye. Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear? Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess. I saw a couple up front that were nice. By the window? No offense, dear, but those are a little out of your price range. Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make. Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear. Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs! At least we get free champagne! And cake. Mm-hmm. Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship? You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works. Ugh. All talking and no sex. Kill me now. I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from. Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months. But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know. Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean. I really don't... Sex. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bastard's kicked. Thanks. Oh! It's okay, guys, I hate it. Just horrible. It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses. You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him. But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello. how do you feel cats? Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal. A cat person. Why am I not surprised? Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats? Maybe he's going to buy you one. I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together? Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying. That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing? Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany. Aw. Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars. Ugly, ugly, ugly. I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun. Are you okay? I'm fine. Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country. I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship. Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket. Somebody say "beautiful princess." Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night. Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something. I know what you mean. You do? Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description. See, that's what I'm afraid of. Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together. Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends. Oh, no way... you're the coolest. No, you are. Okay, I am. I'm going to stay. Aw. Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty. Wow, you look incredible. Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever? Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity. Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married.  Oh, guys, I know I look amazing, but the important thing is that Marshall and I love each other, right? Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake. But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry. Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is. It was like this when I found it? And how will you be paying for this? Credit card... s. In a restaurant I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking. I want you to stay. I have to go to Germany. You're going? Yes. I have to. So that's what you decided? Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go. What is this, opposite day or something? No. So it is? Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me. I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are. Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me? Well, that's just crazy. Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy. But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there. You'd have me. We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this. So... we're breaking up? I guess so. I guess so. At the appartment God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry. It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome. Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today? She's leaving tomorrow. Yeah, but she's still in town. Yeah, she... she's still in town. if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could? Awesome air kicks, huh? New pajama bottoms? You know it. The Bar So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off. Wait, so we're sharing the leg? No, the leg is a metaphor. How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted. Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight? Well, what would you want to do? Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to. Like go to the Mets. Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. See some monkeys at the zoo? Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try? Wow! We better get going. Yeah, big day. Yeah. And, kids, that's exactly what we did with our last day. The museum, the bridge, the restaurant, and all of those nice things. The Bar Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune. No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison. Well, here's hoping he cheats on you. Yeah, but only, like, second base. two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash. Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own. So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp? Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp. Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill. B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price. Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company. You set this up! You set this whole thing up! I most certainly did... Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise. I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress. What time is the interview? 00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy. At the airport I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks. Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sex. I'm going to miss you so much. I'm going to miss you, too. Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can... Even if we're not. Okay. Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance? Yes. Yes! We can beat the odds. Odds, schmodds. It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work. It didn't work. Long-distance was and is a terrible idea, a really terrible idea, just awful. But more on that later. When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old, he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas. It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez, it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon. When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture, Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question. What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist? So you want to be an anthropologist? Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did. What she said next changed his life. Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't. They'll all be dead by then... ...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out. So you don't want coffee. I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible... All right. I'm pouring it out. Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything. I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. "The kid" has become "the man." Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming. Well... I mean... they did their best. Here's your sack lunch. Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word "sack". I love you, Marshmallow. I love you. I love you too, Marshmallow. Uh-oh. Ted? Oh, no. No, she didn't. Yeah. Yeah, she did. Another care package? Another care package. I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month. Long-distance relationships are a bad idea. How many is that so far? Three. And how many have you sent her? In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip.  Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now. God, that is so me at 15. Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel. Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls. I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things... But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff. Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department because he knew someone who worked there. Barney's office Go for Barney. Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building. A sasquatch? That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor. Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction. Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters. Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness... There's one for awesomeness? Yeah, I had it made. Sit. Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is? Please. My dawg! My dawg! Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them. Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you. Nice tie. Steak sauce. Oh, steak sauce! For true, though. Where, I don't, I don't see... Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up. 00 a.m. It's raining outside. Ding dong! What? The doorbell? Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else. But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door? I don't have a back door. Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise. Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go. Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so-- Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go. We're still engaged, even if she's... Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go. The Bar Sure you don't want one? How many of those have you eaten? Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem. Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm! So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb. Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome. Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie. Oh, Teddy boy. Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake. Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&amp;H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago. That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you. That is funny. And here's why it was funny. Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier, here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me. Okay, fine, I have feelings for him. Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like. The irony is clear, Ted. The appartment Hey! How was your first day? I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks. What? They're jerks! What makes them jerks? Forget it, I don't want to talk about it. Well, like today at lunch.. What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch? For your information, my fiancee did. Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too? No. What's that? Nothing. Give it. "Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad." Give it. P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it." Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it! Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable. I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable. Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it. The Bar I quit. What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great. We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do? Please. I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me. Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily. What? Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package? The package? The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while. Lily doesn't care about that stuff. Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver. She'll be happy. Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier. At Marshall's work And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go. I guess, uh... Bea Arthur. Ahh! Wrong! Betty White. Clean this stuff up, Eriksen. The Bar So, did she get the awesome care package yet? Yep. Yesterday. Did she love it? Ooh, she loved it. So what's the problem? So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say. What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah. Oh, Teddy boy. I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do. It's pretty clear. I have to go to Germany and surprise her. Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man! Barney's office Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone? Marshall, consider the penguins. The penguins? On the wall. "Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold." This is a motivational poster? Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier. The appartment Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational. Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool? It sounds kinda like peer pressure. No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year. I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure. All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say? Only when I'm drunk. Good boy. And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla, and that meant gorilla lessons. The Bar Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too. Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched. Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it. I'm psyched! What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Wow, that was really specific. Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt! So badly. And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done. Right. Get what done? Whatever. Cool. And what guy is this? There's always a guy. Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready. You sure? You want to practice your story one more time? All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, "Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs." So I'm, like, "Snapadoo!" So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport... ...and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh. Eriksen...that was steak sauce! Great story. The appartment The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail. Uh-oh. The Bar 00. Victoria." So? Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail? I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you. Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right? I'd wait. The Appartment 'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet. Okay...what do you think? Steak sauce. Steak sauce? Yeah. Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here. Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-... No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office. Why? Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame. Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay? Okay. At the karaoke But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there? Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair. What do you do? Go. Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week. Yeah. You're right. They're delightful. So, Barney, you gonna sing anything? Nah. I'm so over karaoke. Really? I thought you'd be totally into it. Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard. Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do "Don't Go Breaking My Heart." What? "Don't Go Breaking My Heart." Elton John, Kiki Dee. No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath. Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine. "Iron Man." I could do "Iron Man." Steak sauce. Steak sauce, dude. Should we tell him? All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news. On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR. When you graduate, we want you working with us. What do you say? Yes! That's my man! I told you he would. Aw, we're gonna own the office. Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path? Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package. The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package. Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package. Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package. Robin's work place Hello. Why hasn't she called yet? Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something. No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership. I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome. 00. I should let you go. Break a leg. And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me. I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring. At the karaoke Marshall. Hey, hey. Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month. Yeah. Yeah. How you doing? I think Victoria's about to break up with me. Oh, God, I'm sorry, man. Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone. Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law. I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car? Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...? Next up, Marshmallow and Lillypad. 00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke, but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany, who was supposed to call four hours ago. And then the phone rings. Hello. Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over? What do you do? Go. She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and... You have feelings for Ted. Maybe. The Bar I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany. Do you want to try long distance? Yes. "This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight." She's going to dump me! She's not going to break up with you, Ted. Hello? Do you want to come over? Hello. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Let's back up a little bit. Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet.  I'll see you tonight. In Lily's class And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah? Do you have a fiancé? Marshall was here yesterday. They just learned the word "fiancé." Oh, no, I don't have a fiancé. Then who do you live with? Well, actually, I've got five dogs. Don't you get lonely? No, I've got five dogs. My grandma has five cats and she gets lonely. Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is... Does anyone else have a...? Yes? Are you a lesbian? No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les... Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend... So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five. Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive. He has a job doing... What do you do? Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you? No. No. I know what you want. Magic. Hello. Why hasn't she called yet? Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something. What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership. I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. And we're clear. So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend? No, and why does this keep coming up today? Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with... What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things. We should have sex. What? Why not? We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it. And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way. Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with. Get involved? Who said get involved? I'm just saying we should have sex, it could be fun. Having sex is fun. Home number. Call me anytime. A lot of local teens in action tonight... Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted? Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here. Do you want to come over? Why? What's up? Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, "You know who likes juice? Ted." I love juice. Great. So you want to come over and make juice? 00 a.m. are the wrong decisions. Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice. Yes, we'll juice. Okay. Okay... bye. Bye. In a cab This is fine. This is totally fine. What's fine? Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice. Nice. No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh? You ain't kidding, kid. Want a nip? You can just let me out right up here. In another cab Where you going to, buddy? Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house... And you're wondering if I'd be upset. Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend? Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend. Right. You're going to go make some juice. Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy. Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked? I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head. Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head. Damn it! Nothing's going to happen. Right. Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine. At the Karaoke Hey, did she call? No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out. Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin? Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted? What? Yeah, she told me already. Go on. Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me? Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are. Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are. That is a lie! It is not a lie. Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you! I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army! In the cab Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up! Cupcake? No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called? Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now. Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello. Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude. Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen. Ted, what does your mom always say? Nothing good ever... 00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice. Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way. Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me. What? It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted. She-she likes me? Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted. She likes me? Go home, Ted. Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home. Good. He's going home. He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that. What do you mean? "Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sex with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice." No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that. I did have more sense than that. Keep the change. Thanks. 00 a.m, my good sense was sound asleep. So you're doing this? You're going up there? You want to get out of the way? I'm not in the way. You know, if you had just called me, I... Hi. Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets. Or we could just drink wine. Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said. Thanks. Make it a big glass. Sure. So, how's it hanging? Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days? Uh, about once a week. I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend? 00, just go to sleep. We broke up. What? Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me. Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful. You're smiling. Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too. Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about. At the karaoke How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity. Okay, it's time for bed. 30. 00 a.m. 00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way. You never had a four-way. 00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary. We're going home. What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends? Rock 'n' roll. And it begins. At Robin's So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look. Oh, yeah. Do you like it? Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right. Wow. Weird. Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this. I'll be here. Hello? Ted, this is your main man, K.E. I want you to shake your tail feathers down here ASAP, you dig? Sorry about that. Was that Korean Elvis? I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's. Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria. Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude? What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria. Gonna? Yes. First thing tomorrow. 45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way. I hate how you're always right. It's my best and most annoying trait. Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon. Hey. I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I... Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah. Can I call you tomorrow? Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow. Okay. Good night, Robin. Good night, Ted. They embrace each other Oh, my God. We're making out. Right. This is crazy. Right? Right? Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but... Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick. Okay. Stop doing that. Whatcha doin'? I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man. Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive... What do you want from me? People break up. It happens. Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with. It's not ideal. The Bar 00 a.m. Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis? I think he just spat on me. Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going. No! No, come on. Yes! Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the "le". We still got the "gen." The "da." The "ry." Okay, if we're at the "le," then I say we follow it up with a "t's go home." Oh, wow, you just got burned, phonics style. No, no, no, no, no. Baby, baby, baby, don't go. Just one dance, huh? Okay, seriously. Hey, I know what you like. And so, Barney was right-- the night was legendary. It would come to be known as The Time Lily Kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards. Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards? At Robin's You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow. Good. So you're gonna go home? Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry. Ted. It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the gun by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay. Oh, please. You just want to get laid. Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night. That's not your phone. This isn't my phone. Okay. Bye.  I thought it was mine, so I answered it. Was it...? It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back. 00 a.m., just go to sleep. Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours. What do you mean "could"? I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it. Trust that impulse, Ted. Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award. A... LAME-A? We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar. Yes! Word up! Yeah, put me down for two. Really? It's three months away. I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time. I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know. You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night? Yes, that's what I meant by "you know." I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go. You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her. Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs. That's only two. Count again. Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours. So get an escort. By "escort," you mean prostitute? Why not? Because... gross? Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession. You really think that's true? Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out. Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered. Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun. Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with? Yes. No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross? That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute. You just made that up. Withdrawn. Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been? 57 days. Is that your water? May I? Yeah, go ahead. Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump. No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good. Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool. Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp. You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with racists. Good day. You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can... I said good day! At the appartment So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily. What? You okay? Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap. Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe? Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me? Ted's still coming to this thing, right? Yep. Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date? Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous. No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird? No, it's not going to be weird at all.  Robin's bringing a date. Boy. That's going to be really weird. I know. The Bar Robin's bringing a date. Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on. Dude, it's going to be weird. No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird. Yeah, it won't be weird. Thank you. Because you're going to bring your own date. Hello, Barney. Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted? Nice to meet you Ted. Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too. So we're going to an award show? Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney. See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable. What the hell? Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening. You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker! "B" all night long. I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet. The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever. 500 bucks? Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tranny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous. I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul. And then your Uncle Marhsall and I had one of our famous telepathic conversations. Check out Robin's date. I know. Is that who I think it is? Yep. It's Sandy Rivers. Sandy Rivers was the face of Metro News One, the most low-budget cable news network ever. Sandy time. Sandy time! He was best known for his morning segment "In Today's Paper," during which he literally flipped through today's papers, reading them aloud to viewers. Here we have, on the front page, a story about a... I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building. Looks interesting. These idiotic filler pieces were a guilty pleasure of ours. Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, porn star Sandy...? Yosemite Sandy, definitely. Excellent choice. I love this guy. I hate this guy. Hey. Hi. I'm Lily. Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you. Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer. Hey. Hi. You look nice. Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy. Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it. Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh... Starting a bunch of office rumors?  Looks that way. Looks that way. Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date. At the ceremony Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards. Please say hello to our host for the evening, king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie, Vampire Lou! Tonight we celebrate the very best in broadcasting and the triumph of the human spirit. Man, Vampire Lou just looks great. I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker. Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there. Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? "Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sex for money." Who has sex for money? Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting? No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off. Lily, you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky. Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky. "Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky." Wow. Why are you so tired? Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time. Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money. Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance. Well, it's just an internship, for the record. Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me? A prostitute. Exactly. Thank you, Mary. So, Mary, what do you do for a living? She's a paralegal. Yes, I'm a paralegal. Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly? I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown. Oh, what firm? Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp. That's a real law firm. I know. Nice. You're pretty good on your feet. Are you flirting with me? Is that allowed? Yes, it's encouraged. You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot! Well, thank you. You're welcome. Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute. So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning. You got me. What do you do, Ted? Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific. Thanks. I never tire of hearing that. Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning? You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter. And so, as the night wore on, I started to realize, this girl, despite what she did for a living, was kind of great. Hey. Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else? I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened. And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits. So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now? We're still friends. Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face? Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous? Oh, so now she's a whore? What? You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying. I like that guy. Hey. Hey. What were you guys talking about over there? Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome. Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in. Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing. Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room. Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30. Sleep with a prostitute? No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships. You just made that up. Withdrawn. Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed. I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool. Yeah, well... there we go. Scooter "Bam-Bam" Branson for A Bicycle-- Joyride or Deathtrap? Mike Murphy for 13, Pregnant and Addicted. And Robin Scherbotsky for Pickles, the Singing Dog. And the winner is... Robin Scherbotsky. Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you. Congratulations. Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab? Sure. Let's go. Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room. Dude, what are you doing? What's it look like? It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this. Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous. Oh, that's real mature. Marshall, what is up with you and Ted? Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey. Should we go? Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night. Good night. In the elevator So, did you and Barney ever...? There's not enough money in the world. Oh, thank God. Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers? I put him in a cab. So you and he aren't...? I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...? He's off trying to make you jealous. Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool. Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute. Mary's a prostitute? What?! Barney paid for her. Is that true? We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs. Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown? Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah! That's her napkin. No! Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors? "Mary's not really a prostitute." What? That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done. So she's not...? No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean. In the hall of the hotel I feel kind of like Richard Gere. Not shy about your looks, are you? No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before. Done what? You know, been... on a "date." Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right? No. Why, is that so odd? Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15. God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and... Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long. Must be tough. Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about anal. Well, here we are. Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker. What? Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have sex with a prostitute. No... Ted, I'm a paralegal. Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker. No, Ted... I'm a paralegal. No, you're a hooker. No, I'm a paralegal. You're a paralegal. The Bar That was not funny. Not funny, dude. I know, it was hilarious. Why would you do that? I did it to prove a point. What point? Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over. So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore? Come on, dude, you should be thanking me. She slapped me and stormed off. Can you blame her? You called her a hooker. I'm sorry, dude, it was funny. Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room. Your room? 00. Got a massage. Toodles. Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean. Kids, about eight months into Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's engagement, there occurred a game-changing emergency. Van Smoot is available. Oh, my God! Van Smoot House was a gorgeous mansion right on the Hudson River. It had everything Marshall and Lily wanted for their wedding, but it was never available. And then, suddenly, it was. There was a cancellation two months from now. You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible. It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream! No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit. Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check. Todd and Valerie? When you're planning a wedding, there's always one couple with similar taste that seems to be one step ahead of you. Todd and Valerie were that couple. We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot! Oh! Kids, color! Come on, baby. Come on, come on, come on. Hello, Marshall. Lily. Todd. Valerie. Stairs. The Bar I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House. It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. What? You're a wonder. Wow! You guys are getting married in two months. How are you going to get everything done? Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist. Robin had been mad at me since the night I slightly exaggerated my not-having-a-girlfriend-ness. Was it...? It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back. Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations. Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now. Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do? Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me. Lil, you know I can't promise that. At the appartment Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad. Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing. Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88! Who? The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking. I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great. John "Bonzo" Bonham from Led Zeppelin? Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago. Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition. Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands. Well, then... I have to say no. Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday. Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend? Let me check their Website. What? Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing. Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay? Wow. Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer. We already have a caterer. Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a... It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow. A prom? Can... can we go to that? Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch. Yeah. No, they won't. Why not? 'Cause it turns out we're not in high school. No sweat, we'll just sneak in. We're not sneaking in to a high school prom. Yes, we are. It's the only way. You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped. It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything. Well... No, Barney. The Bar And so, Aunt Lily had the plan to crash the prom. I'll go with you. Really? Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring. Lesbian. The cough is supposed to cover the "lesbian." No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate. Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school? Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got "statutory" written all over your body. Hey, why don't we all go? I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily. Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night? Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird. Yeah. 'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw. Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later. At the appartment All right, what do you think? Horrible. You're gonna make such a great dad. You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home. Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have... Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it. All right. That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up! In the bedroom I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough. I didn't know I still had this. What? The dress I wore to my actual prom. Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul. Aw, you look great, too, Scooter. So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in! Oh, disco! I am so happy for you. You mean happy for us, right, babe? Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday. No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday. Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing. No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore... Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers. Aw. Sweet. Thank you. Oh, Robin, are you tearing up? No. I've never been to prom before, okay? We got to go. See ya. Bye, have fun. See you. They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted? So, what, we ready for tonight? Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first. Shot of Jim Beam? Yeah. Yes! And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations. What?! I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is. Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad. Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize. Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking? Outside the prom Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids. Is this gonna work? Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo! Uh, you're adults. Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and... And you're just finding a band? Hey, ho, hey! I'm sorry, ma'am. You either need to be a student or the date of a student. Wow. "Ma'am?" Check and mate. It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky? Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom? We don't have that kind of money. For free. Oh, hell yeah! Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily. Hi. Shall we? Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream. Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in? Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in. Inside the building We're in! Thank you. We're going to take a break. Oh, you're kidding me. Hey, uh, you ladies want something to take the edge off? Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup. Yeah, we couldn't get any alcohol. Um, our fake IDs say we're only 20. We didn't realize it till after we bought them. Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys. Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play "Good Feeling" by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fiancé wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play "Good Feeling" because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right? Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song. So, you buzzing, baby? My phlegm feels looser. At the appartment This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back? You know it. I'd have your back, too. That's cool. What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker. Okay, Ted.  Hello. Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for "Good Feeling" and bring it out here, like, now. Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come? Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway. Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us. What'd she say? What'd she say? He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes. Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come. At the prom All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay? There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast. How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years. I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already. What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open! Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us. You're, you're breaking up with me? There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain. I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby. Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much! It's just one dance, God! What? Well, we did promise them one dance. Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight? Well, you know I got it all worked out. Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something. No, you won't. I won't? No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering "Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?" Whoa. You really think I'll get a girlfriend? So, uh, what's the deal here? Am I getting lucky tonight? Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight. Okay, just be cool. Don't look at me. Okay. How'd you get in here? What's it to you, giant turtle? It's me, Barney. Oh, hey. Where's Lily? She's in the bathroom. Wait here, I should go talk to the band. All right. How did you guys get in here? We just snuck in the back. You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume. But you got in. Slow and steady won the race. Hey, bro, have you seen my fiancée Lily? Your fiancée? Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro. Unless you're looking for trouble. Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but... No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this. I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me. Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away. Yah! Nunchaku! I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior. I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts? Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her. I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy cafés for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again? Marshall. Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates. Yeah. It works. Violent Femmes. I love this song. Me, too. I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it. Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined? Yeah. And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy? Yeah. So field hockey, huh? Shut up. Outside Trespassing, assaulting a minor. This mascot costume you stole cost $5,000. We can have you guys arrested, you know that? Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here. I totally could have taken that kid. Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so... Well, I don't need it, but thanks. Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome. No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song. Absolutely not. You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...? Hey! You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick. This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy. So how was your first prom? You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl. So, basically, it was a prom. Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way. I'll take what I can get. And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club. So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song. Yeah, it's good. Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months. Two months. At the Bar And for the birthday boy, lasagna. Thank you. Careful. The plate is very hot. 'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it. Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate. All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what? Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this. I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted. You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy. Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney. Oy, gevalt. Ah... Happy birthday, Ted. Whoo-hoo! Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God. What? Oh! Call an ambulance! What's going on? Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk. Is she okay? I'm serious, call 911. What's wrong? What's the matter? Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh! You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Wait for it. 28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh. Actually, my 30th birthday wasn't so bad. Well, except for the goat in my bathroom. Which is a great story. But I'll get to that later. Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking? Nope. I hit the snooze button. And here come the paramedics. Oh, thank God, you're here. What is going on?! I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital. What are you talking about? You've had a terrible fall. No, I haven't. Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What? Give him your number. Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me. Give him your number. What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number. All right! It works! I cannot believe that she gave him her number. Maybe she really does have a brain injury. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good. I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect. Well, what's perfect? It's not like I have a list. Oh, yes, you do. Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl... That's not hard. I know at least... I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies. Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth. Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky. You're never going to find this girl. Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable. So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it? That's the plan. And little did I know, at that very moment, fate... in the form of a 600 gigahertz superprocessing computer... was taking care of it. At the appartment Whoa, you're up early. Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes. Does Marshall know? He's still sound asleep. Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up. Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good? Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday. God, why didn't you throw it away? I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk. Oh...! These pancakes are delightful. What's wrong, baby? This is the high point of my day. It was true. See, Marshall had always dreamed of using his law degree to protect the environment. But he needed money for the wedding, so he'd been interning for two months at Barney's firm... and he hated every minute of it. Barney's office Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms. Binoculars. Second pair on my desk. I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do. Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs. So? So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture. Oh! Sweet Lord. And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him. Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that? Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first shot. You? Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great. What? Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is war, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late. This is stupid. Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering skills. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant. This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do. Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him. Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer... I get it. Thank you, Tracy. At the appartment Hello? Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby? Speaking. Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago. Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match. Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate. At Love Solutions I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place? Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am. So I'm in good hands. You found me a match? There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks. No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged. She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file. So I read the file. And by God, this woman was perfect. She liked dogs, she spent her summers in North Carolina, she played bass guitar, she did the Times crossword, she played tennis, she liked old movies, her favorite food was lasagna, her favorite book was Love in the Time of Cholera, her favorite singer was Otis Redding and she wanted two kids-- a boy and a girl. All right, fine. Set it up. Barney's office You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again? Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf. Tastes normal to me. That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield. Oh, God! It got me as well. Well, then why did you have me drink it?! Because now... you're in. Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that bastard pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first? Yeah, it's probably a good idea. In a bar So that night I had a blind date with my perfect match. I was so excited, I got there early. But before it even started... Lily? Hey, Ted, are you busy? Um... yes. Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero? What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall? Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry? I can't, I'm waiting... Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no! Come on, Lily. But you see my point. All right, stay there. I'm on my way. At Duchess County And so, one $90 cab ride later, I was in the middle of nowhere. Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date? Yes. And was she okay about pushing it back? Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here? You can never tell Marshall. I won't. Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl. I swear on Luke and Leia. About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary. Did you talk to Marshall about it? He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super Bomber Man... That was you? Awesome! I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship. Let me guess. It's somewhere far away. San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven. You don't want to get married. Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this. Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means. Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid. I don't think you're stupid. I love Marshall. I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out. But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy? Barney's office So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice. At Duchess County All done. Ted, let's go to New Haven. Lily, don't do this to yourself. I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure. No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake. Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, "Yep. That was a mistake." So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you? I don't know. You said "mistake" a lot. Lily, don't do this. Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this. Forgive you for what?  Hey, I need a big favor. Anything, bro. I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up. No. It's kind of an emergency. What are you doing in Duchess County? Apple picking. Can you just get up here? I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped. Is that Ted? Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County. Don't you have a big date tonight? Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do. So what are you doing in Duchess County? Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn! Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you. No! Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero. No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County. So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County? Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go. Barney's office Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield. You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there. You thinking about coming to work here full-time? Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay? Taking off for the night. Thanks, Tracy. Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box? Of course we are. Were you going to think of that? No. That would have been bad. Horrible. At Duchess County Luckily, there was still one person I could call to get a ride home. Need a ride, cowboy? Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers. Hmm, too bad. I got candy. Candy?! So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County? Nope. Sworn to secrecy. Oh, come on. I like your hat. Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights. Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine. Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took "highlights" to mean, "I want to look like a tiger," hence the hat. Oh. I gotta see this. No way. Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat! So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist? Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me. Wow, I'm 28. Hmm. Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check. I read that. More like "Love in the Time of Don't Bothera." You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying. We're not indoors. We're in a van. Vans have doors-- let me see your hair. Never. What else? She loves lasagna. Barf. You know, I am sensing a pattern here. What else? Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check. And she's looking to get married and have kids? Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl. Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids. Really? You don't want kids? 56. You're early. Hey, thanks for picking me up. Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for. Thanks. All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do. You're going to show me your hair? Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair. You just made my night. Go. At the appartment Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude. Hey, guys. Hi. Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk? Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it. You think you might want to... drink the milk? No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk. Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude? I didn't go. What? Why? I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her. Why? She sounds perfect. I don't want perfect. I want Robin. Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake. Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make. Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again... Here's the thing about mistakes. Sometimes, even when you know something's a mistake, you gotta make it anyway. Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate. Hey, is this milk any good? Even really really dumb mistakes. At the Bar So... what do you think? Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you. But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life? Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills? Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this.  Ow! What the hell? That wasn't me. That was the universe. The funny thing was, at that very moment, the universe was working on something... a storm. At Metro News One And so tropical storm Willy is going to be with us at least until Monday. It's gonna rain cats and dogs, folks. So don't step in a poodle. Sandy? Robin? Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend. Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck. Guess we'll have to take a rain check. And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York. Have a great night. And, we're clear. Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex with you this weekend, Scherbotsky. Well, I'd give you the "I don't date coworkers" speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now. Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing. At the Bar Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, "enough"? One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever. So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture? I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment. Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name... Universe. So, this plan you speak of? Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked. Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that? At Robin's appartment She should be here any second. Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza? Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just... Damn it. Hello. Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key. Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment? Yes, I gave it to you. Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it. Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith. No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock. Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained. Hello, Lily, this is Janet Kagan at the Russell House Art Foundation here in San Francisco. I'm pleased to inform you that we've accepted your application for our summer fellowship. We look forward to hearing from you. Bye-bye. Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay? Summer fellowship? Just knock. Okay. Hi. Hi. Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say? Yes. No. I don't know. Those are the three options. Ted, this is so... I know. I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait. Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza. No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here. Sure. We're not getting any pizza. Okay. Let's talk. Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five? Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks.  You're crazy. Right. Come on. It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again. I know. But... come on... And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this. Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious. I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping. I thought that thing was canceled. Well, it's back on. Since when? Since like an hour ago. ..sending the storm back out into the Atlantic. So it's blue skies this weekend. Sandy? Robin? Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York. And we're clear. You're leaving? There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN. Oh, congratulations. Congratulations yourself. What do you mean? Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised. Wow. Thanks. And, yes. Yes, what? Yes, let's go get dinner. How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie. Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing. Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip. Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date? I don't-I don't know. So, what? You actually like this guy now? I don't know. Are you gonna hook up with him? I don't know. Yes, you do. No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do. I don't plan out every... Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, "Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi?" No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together. Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake. I need to think about this. Fine. No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer. If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that. Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no. Then I guess it's not meant to be. At the Bar Nice try, buddy. Good hustle out there. Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on. Screw that. This ain't over. Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said... I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be. Unpause? Unpause. Let's pause. See, Marshall and Lily had a rule that at any point during a fight they could pause and take a break. Their fights often lasted for days. A painting fellowship? I was never going to take it. In California? I was never going to take it. Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend. Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is. What are you talking about? I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain! Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time. Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture? Yeah. Are you still in touch with her? Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her! Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance. Did you just say a "rain dance"? Yes. A rain dance. Yes. A dance to make it rain. Yes.  We're finding Penelope! No, we are not! Yes, we are! Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me! Inside a library Why the hell should I help you? Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship. We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship? Twice! Barney, there is no way... Shh! Seriously, come on. Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend. Why? There's this girl... "There's this girl." You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid. Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please. This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass? Absolutely. Kind of like Barney? Kind of. Hey. You hit on my mom! We weren't exclusive! I'm in. And so the three of us headed up to the roof of my building. On top of the roof of Ted's building Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit. Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position. I will throw you off this roof. There's so much of your mom in you. Robin is at the veterinary with her dog And she's been throwing up ever since. So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate? Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates... Oh, that's so sweet. Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that? Nobody does that. Exactly. No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now. At the appartment So you're saying you would forbid me from going? Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me...  I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted. Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever. So now we've gone from "I was never gonna do it" to "I need to do this"? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen? Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it. I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all. Maybe not. Pause. So, are you just, like, starving? Red Lobster? Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious! Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you. I wouldn't dare.  Marshall, no. We're on pause. There's no crying in Pauseland! Pauseland is a magical place, with... with popcorn shrimp mountains and butter sauce rivers! Damn it! Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy... On top of the rooftop of Ted's building Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad. Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right? I think so. Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance? I think so. Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed? No. No? firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological... Have you ever seen a rain dance? I've seen a film strip. Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves. What do you mean "we," white man? At the appartment How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge. I think there's still one left. Dibs. Unpause? Unpause. Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it. I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't. Why not? Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen? Marshall... 'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out. Marshall, I love you. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen? Pause. No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?! Pause! Why do you want me to pause?!  That's just a great use of the pause function, baby. Thank you. On top of the rooftop of Ted's building Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing? A rain dance. Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants. Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour. These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work! Yeah. I know that. Well, then why are you doing this? Come on! Oh, come on! In the street Pushing the front back into the Tri-State area and giving Manhattan one of its worst storms in over a decade. At the Bar How about that? He did it. In front of Robin's building Robin! Hey, Robin!  Oh, thank God you're here! My camping trip got rained out. I know. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Yeah, it is. Come down here. It's pouring. You come up. No, you have to come down here. Why? Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here! I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up. I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here! I was gonna... I know. And that's how Robin and I ended up together. Turns out, all I had to do was make it rain. As I rode home the next morning, the city looked the same, the people looked the same. It all looked the same. But it wasn't. In just one night, everything had changed. OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn. Can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom? I feel you've been talking for like a year Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story. Can I go to the bathroom? No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. . Year 2006 So that's it? We're breaking up? Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while. For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again. Later, Ted joined Marshall. I should call her. No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face. You're a good friend Ted. Hey! So, did you hear the big news? You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows. Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened? Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back. I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry. Thanks. I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you? Sure. For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting "What's up New York?" we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... . Oh man, you guys did it, didn't you?! CREDIT TITLES One thing I learned that summer is that when love is beginning . Hey Marshall. Hey Ted. Are you hungry? What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me. At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day! Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped. Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you? Beer. No, that's what you had for dinner. Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover DAY THIRTY-ONE, Ted, Robin and Barney are at MacLaren's. So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fiancée. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed. You should write and illustrate children's books. You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story. It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess. Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is. Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's... What? God, your eyes are so blue. Teddy bear... Yeah it was hard to feel too bad. I was dating the woman of my dreams and things were going great. Well, for the most part. . So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time. That's my shampoo. Oh. Sorry. Ted and Robin are in Ted's bedroom, making out. I thought he's never go to sleep. Uh-oh. Already? He's calling her. Dammit! I don't hear anyth... He's calling her!  Argh! Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her. Marshall comes in the bathroom, Ted and Robin are taking a shower together. Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? ‘Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them! Does he know I'm in here? Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins... At MacLaren's. This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night... Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it! They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace. He slept on our floor last night Ted. He watched a scary movie. It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine. Mmm. Sunshine. DAY FORTY-ONE, in a strip club. Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine! Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help. Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's ‘cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's. There are a lot of them. They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four. DAY FORTY-FOUR, at a base-ball game. Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning! I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside. Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise. Oh, no. It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart!  You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul! DAY FORTY-SIX, at MacLaren's. We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair. So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat Häagen-Dazs and Watch « Love actually » until your periods sync up? At a shooting-range, Robin is shooting. Yeah, that's the stuff. Oh my God! How long have you been doing this? My Dad taught me to shoot when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... guns are fun! Um, you know, Ted is kinda against guns. That's why Ted never gonna find out about this. Whoa! That sort of got scary with me holding a gun, didn't it? No, I just mean, please don't tell Ted. You wanna try? Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... I should have mention the recoil. At MacLaren's. I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? ‘Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that. Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win. Oh! What do I win? I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend. You are? That's so nice! My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there. Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this? DAY FIFTY-FIVE, at the apartment. Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car. Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong? It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address. So? I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there. No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already. I know, but I just... DAY FIFTY SIX, at MacLaren‘s. Marshall is holding Lily's credit card bill which he stuck back together. August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right? Marshall daydream, in San Francisco. Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around. Only the best for my little Lily Pad. Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style. I am so glad you agreed to play tennis with me. Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him. I got you a gift. Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets. I bet that's something he made you promise to tell nobody. It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton. I love you too, Lily. That's right Marshall, she's all mine. Now I'm gonna let her play with my hair. Back at MacLaren's. That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable. Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats. Those charges are from a month ago. Exactly! For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... . Why do you talk? Why do you talk? At the apartment. He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password. There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York.  I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer. This has been holding in together? OK, you know what? I'm calling her. No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. . While we're away this weekend can you keep an eye on him? Make sure he doesn't call her hotel. You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza. Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple. Marshall! Marshall! Marshall! Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to! Everything we've worked so hard for...! Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you. Hang up now! Ted, I can't hang up now. Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up! Hello?!  A guy answered. There is... There is a guy in her room. I'm going down there. No! Dude, you can't... I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees. Marshall, you can't do that! Really? Why not? 56 days. That's how long it took me to get right about here. Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a shot in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a shot somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car? Bold. Bold to go for the car. In the car. What? I didn't say a thing. You think I was too hard on him. I didn't say a thing. I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love. Yeah, tough love, not « hand the guy a noose ». Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a gun nut? No, I'm a gun enthusiast. Do you know how many people are killed... The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms... Alright, alright. I was too hard on him. A little. I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing. Barney. Uh, hey. Where are you guys? We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college. Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK? Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh. Already? What? What uh-oh? He's gone. You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel. Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted! Barney! Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place? A really nice one. At Lily's hotel. Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall! Hey. What happened? Well, I went up to Lily's floor... ...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. . You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend? Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend. What? Who was he? His name was Joey Adalian. He went by a number of aliases as an identity thief. Apparently, earlier in the summer... Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards? Yes, I do. So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right? Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone. You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily. Ted. Yeah. I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean. What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers. OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers. Cheers. DAY FIFTY-SEVEN, at the apartment. But it wasn't. ‘cause that's no how life works. The next day he found one of her socks or something and we were back to square one. And then, one morning... DAY SIXTY-SEVEN, still at the apartment. Ted. Ted you should see this. Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing? It's Sunday. It's pancakes day. It took him 67 days and one really disgusting batch of pancakes, but Marshall had come back from the dead. Because while baseball, strippers and guns can help, the only thing that can really heal a broken heart is time. At MacLaren's. Alright, see you guys later. I'll walk you out. See ya. You just checked out Robin's ass. What? No. I... Barney, I was... Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead. Lily. Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass. I did not Ted... Awesome! You're finally getting better. This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in. Yes! Oh, God! Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like? Candy. Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones? Mounds. Milk Duds. Gobstoppers. Um... This went on for another hour. I'll just skip to the end. Dubble Bubbles. Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer. Fine. Hey Robin. Marshall checked out your ass. Ted, what is wrong with you? He checked out my ass? Hey, tell him thanks. I felt like I was having a bad ass day. Cool. See ya. Robin reaches her apartment. Lily is on her landing. Lily. It is a great ass. CREDIT TITLES None of us had seen Lily in three months. There were so many unanswered questions, so many things to say. Your hair is adorable! Thank you! At MacLaren's. Meanwhile, Barney was taking Marshall out to meet women for the first time since he was 17. Hi. Have you met Marshall? Hi. Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you. I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh...  Do you like magic? Umm... I guess.  Anyway, Marshall here is awesome. Salad in a bag? His idea! In a snack bar. Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl. You went home with her! Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a shot with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar... Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again. Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies! Oh, really? My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night. Oh, come on. Does that really work? Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't. Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in. At the apartment, Robin arrives. You've gotta hear this. You will not believe what just happened. You go first. I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen... Lily is back in town. And you let me go first?! Have you seen her? Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today. How is she doing? You're not gonna like it. I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now. She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever. Oh, the art program, best thing ever. In San Francisco, Lily is painting. Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. . In New-York, with Robin. But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry. In San Francisco, in a bus. Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel. I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah! I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way. In New-York. Wow, I am so happy for you. Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret. You never chose sides. I respect that. She's unbelievable! Unbelievable! Unbelievable? What's unbelievable? Uh, listen Marshall... Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting. Way to go. OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him. No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on? She's moved on? Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom,  with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey? At MacLaren's. corollary five. Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands. Excellent. Have you chosen your entrée? I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar. Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it. Hey four-eyes. You got astigmatism or something? I'm sorry, I was trying to be playful but I just got out of a lonf relationship. I have no idea what I'm doing! I'm Marshall. Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on. Nice recovery. I think it's working. Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy. Hey Barney, nice to meet you. Hi. Amy, do you like... magic? At the apartment. I hate you. I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real victim here. Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy! I know but tonight... No, forget it. You're such a jackass! I though you were gonna call me a jerk. All right, I'm sorry. But I will make it up to you. Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near NYU. The Scorpion &amp; The Toad. I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly. And, as a third-year law student, more smarter. OK, but no magic. . How did you do that? I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass. In a building. Robin and I went apartment hunting with Aunt Lily. But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing. Yeah. It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox. What? She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it! No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy. Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years. Trust me, I'm  a girl! Yeah. But you're Canadian. Why do you always have to bring that up? You're our weird neighbors! You bring it up every time... No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall. You're on. Five American bucks. Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her? Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything. I hope this is my new home.  Yeah, I'm gonna take that first apartment. At the apartment, Barney knocks at the door, Marshall opens. Marshall Eriksen, suit up! No way. Yeah you're good in that. Let's go. Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on. Come on... Sleeves. There is nothing in my sl... Oh is that right? Huh? Huh? Let's go. Behind my ear. Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh! Ohh! At « The Scorpion &amp; the Toad » bar. Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's killing me though. Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does kill you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah. In an other spot of « the Scorpion &amp; the Toad ». You must be majoring in chemistry ‘cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh...  College lesbian phase. Back to Marshall and the first girl. Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again. Yes, it would. It really would. Maybe I'll see you here sometimes. Probably not. I'm never here, so... You know, I do have a phone number. Great. Nice. Hi, I'm Barney. Oh, no. Do you mind giving my friend your phone number? Sure. In a cab. Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What? Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too. I'll kill you! At Robin's apartment. And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall? In the cab, Marshall still chokes Barney. Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna... I'm not giving you... Back at Robin's. Terrific. That is so good to hear. . OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy. I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. . Interesting.  Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit? No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him. The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! In the cab. Stop it! You don't want to see me when I'm angry! Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. . Stop the cab! No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. . Oh, she does have a cute handwriting. In a snack-bar. About hangovers - everyone has their own special remedy. Morning guys, what can I get you? Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake. For you, sir? Gravy. You want that gravy on something? Surprise me. I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good. What are you charpy about? She's still drunk from last night. I don't think so! Whoo! Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him? I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really... But it's good, I mean work's great... Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now?  And, hey, how is Marshall? It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him. But I thought your summer was great?! Not exactly... Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything. So all those interesting people you met on the bus...? Yeah, um... I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel. I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. I'm Dan. I'm a neurosurgeon. You are stunning, by the way. I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back? In a heartbeat. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms. Wow. So, maybe I should call him? Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word "maybe". "Maybe" cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost killed him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain , stay the hell away from him. This guy like pennies! At MacLaren's. Hi Marshall. No, go away, I don't want to talk to you. OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had sex with you. There is no "would" in sex. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it. You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't. That's not possible. Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes! A twin isn't the same person. Of course, it is. What do you think "identical" means? "Ident-" - same. "-ical" - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date. Fine. Ah! But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin. Used-up? They're a human being Marshall. So Uncle Marshall and Uncle Barney went out on a double date with the twins. How are you doing? Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking. You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening. It is impossible that you're doing this to me again. But they're twins. You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store. Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend... Ted's my best friend. ...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. . Oh bad news. Marshall got food poisoning. What? That's so bad. I really liked him. Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight. Outside of MacLaren's, Marshall runs into Lily. Lily. What are you doing here? Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello. Lily, this was the worst summer of my life. I know. It was the worst summer of my life. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through. Can we please get back together? All that crap you said to me about "we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own.". It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart. Can we please get back together? Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now. Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair. Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. . And the pizza there. Worst pizza ever! I'm so glad to be back in New-York. Yeah. Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you. Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why. In MacLaren's, Barney is still with the twins. So then, I was promoted to assistant ménage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that?  Lily? You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant ménage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it! You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! . Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played. Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong. Year 2006 I wish your face would melt off. I wish your eyeballs would explode. I hate you. I hate you more. I'm going to kill him. I can't say I blame you. No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him. I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him. Not now. Okay, if you don't, I will. Robin...! Okay, for any of this to make sense, you got to understand, there are three parts to this story. Let's start with the Marshall and Lily part. The Marshall and Lily part. The previous day, at the apartment. As a 30th anniversary gift, I had flown my parents to New York for the weekend. Oh, I forgot to tell you, your cousin Jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited. You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine? Coffee? You know, Grandma and Grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable, emotional, or in any way... real. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby. Oh, Lily! Hi, Marshall. Good to see you. I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things. Yes, we were so sorry to hear about your... You know, the, the... Well... Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me? Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me? I love your hair. OPENING This was only the second time Marshall and Lily had seen each other since breaking up, but to their credit, it wasn't that awkward. Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good. 00. Lily, would you like to join us? Um... What? Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable. Why would it? Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us. Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister. "Brother and sister"?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. See? Not awkward at all. The evening, at "Casa a Pezzi". Lily arrives. Hello, everyone. Hi. Hello, Marshall. Lily, that is a stunning dress. Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, "Hey, we're all family." Right, bro? Ooh, ah... What's wrong? Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just...  Are you all right? You're kind of sweating. No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy. The next morning, at the apartment. Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too. Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch. No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves. That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part. Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs. I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology. At brunch. So Marshall showed up at brunch with a plan. Hello. Oh, hi. Hey, Marshall. Hey. Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night. Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it? Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of...  What are you doing? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable.   Oh. Oh, yes. I've been doing all these toe lifts lately, and so... My calves have really been cramping up. Marshall and Lily are in the restaurant bathroom. Take off your dress. Take off the rest of your pants. Later, leaving the bathroom and joining the table. I really wasn't expecting that to happen. Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg. Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs. Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me. Seduce you? You seduced me. You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off. You went to San Francisco for three months. How is that seducing you? Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it. All right, that's it - I want The Beatles Anthology. Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews. You are evil. Smile! I'm going to kill him. I can't say I blame you. No, I mean I'm seriously going to kill him. Now let's talk about the Barney part of the story. The Barney part. The previous day, at the apartment. This was going to be Robin's first time meeting my parents, so we were both a little nervous. Barney, what are you doing here? Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them. I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories. What? baseball. But I'm your best friend. Well, actually Marshall's my... I'm the most important person in your life. Well, Robin's actually... How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful. To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have. Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today. Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. Ted. I know you've all been excited to meet... Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint "Bless This Mess" pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin. Hello. Hello. Oh, it's wonderful to meet you, Robin. Oh, you are so pretty. Isn't she pretty, Al? A real looker. 00. San Marino! Oh, you're serious? Yikes. No. We have to try Casa A Pezzi. Best salmon risotto I have ever had. I love salmon risotto. I know. How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks. Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because... Stop it! Don't, don't! Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin? In the kitchen. What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass. Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five! Can I help? Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it. Well, funny you should ask... At "Casa a pezzi". Barney is playing the piano. Whoa! Bravo, Barney. Oh, oh oh! That is my all-time favorite sonata.Barney, you are just delightful. No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening. Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold. All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute. Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's? No, I'm kind of tired. Me, too. Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want... I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas. Cervezas? Did he fall? I'd join you, too, but I want to get up early for Mass tomorrow. 45 a.m., it's my favorite service. Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church? I'll save you a seat. Oh, you are just terrific. Isn't he, Susan? Robin. Susan, her name is Virginia. The next morning, at the aprtment. Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now. Why? Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right? So Barney darts back into the burning house, lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety. Wow. You're like a hero. Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry. You poor, brave man. Why don't you give the guy a hug? I'm... oh. . My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool? I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom. Sure. Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back... Barney arrives in the bar, sees Ted's father making out with Wendy and takes a photo of them with his phone. Back at the apartment, he hands Ted the phone) Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God! I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that? My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible. Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side. Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use "83%"? You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is natural\ legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ. That's not a real Web site. Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K. Hi, Dad. Hey, Ted. Barney! Enjoying your vacation so far? Oh, yeah. Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec? Sure. Outside. So you went out with Barney last night? Yeah. You have a good time? Oh, yeah, yeah. Sorry you couldn't join us. Yeah. So... What? Well... Well what? You think Cerrano's got a shot at the RBI title? At brunch. I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure. Smile! I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him. Not now. Okay, if you don't, I will. Robin...! Okay, now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and Robin part of the story. The me and Robin part. The previous day, at the apartment. We were expecting my parents at any minute. One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids. But this is the first time she's meeting me. six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park. But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say? You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them. I'm gonna lie. I would. At "Casa a pezzi". Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set. I know how important it is to you. I talked to Aunt Caroline the other day. Stacy's pregnant again. Oh, good for her. So, dear... Oh, boy. Tell us what it's like being a journalist. I'm just not ready. Okay. No pressure. Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great. Good. Focus on your job now, because your career clock is ticking. There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later. Ooh, a piano! The next morning, at the apartment. You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right? Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with. Hooray? I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman. Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important. At brunch. What happened to Marshall and Lily? They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it. More coffee? Oh, no, thank you. Isn't she sweet? Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies. Excuse me? Nothing. Just a minute. Maybe less. Robin, dear, did I say something to upset you? Why don't you want me to have your grandkids? Do you want to have my grandkids? No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and... Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line. Marshall, your zipper. Robin, it's not that I don't want grandkids. It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young. Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it? Well... Okay, there's something you don't know... Back to the table. Smile! I wish your face would melt off. I wish your eyeballs would explode. I'm gonna kill him. I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him. Not now. Okay, if you don't, I will. Robin...! Oh, gosh, let me help you pick those up, sweetheart. Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy!  I'm sorry, you're not a floozy. I'm upset, I don't know what I'm saying. But stay away from my dad. Ted, what are you talking about? Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night? Okay. I hooked up with a waitress. Oh. Oh? I mean, oh! Oh! Ooh! We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home, Al. Oh, ooh! Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care? Mrs. Mosby? Ted, we weren't quite sure how to tell you this... Your mother and I are divorced. What do you mean you're divorced? Since when? Oh, gosh, it's been about nine months now. Closer to ten, I think. Time flies. So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me? No, it wasn't a snap decision. We'd been separated almost two years. How could you not tell me this?! We meant to, it just never seemed like the right time. So last Christmas...? We talked about telling you kids then, but it didn't seem very Christmasy. I got you a tandem bike. Oh, it didn't go to waste. Your mother and Frank ride it all the time. Who the hell is Frank?! Oh, great guy. I actually set them up. You remember Dr. Muchnik. He did your braces. Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. Teddy bear, oh... You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station. Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things. Me, too. I just find it really confusing to be around you right now. It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while. Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra? Did you Mystic Tan your calves? I withdraw the question. Outside. We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce. It was wrong not to tell you. Thank you. But listen, don't tell your sister. It would just upset her. No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball. Indians won today on a walk-off double. Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met. I never told you how I met your mother? No. Oh, great story. At a bar. That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story. I think it was an Irish bar. I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened? We just realized we're very different people. Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic, and I'm much more down to earth. So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything. I wanted kids. And your mother... also wanted kids. Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it. On some level, I always knew. I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning. But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in. Well, when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels, it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together. But we love Robin. Absolutely. Meeting you was the highlight of my trip. Well, second highlight. We'll see you inside. Sorry. Wow. I know. They love me! Back inside, later. So we are definitely going to try and communicate more. From now on, full disclosure. Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls. I'm gonna get some juice. No. No. You missed a great game last night. Real squeaker. At MacLaren's, Ted arrives. Well, we just had our first fight. Robin joins Lily at a chiroposdist's place. We had our first fight. MacLaren's. Oh, no, what'd you fight about? . A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building... Chiroposdist's place. It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. MacLaren's. And if we don't get it, we could go under. Chiropodist's place. So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company. MacLaren's. No. Yes. Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a... Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front. Wow, so it's the whole package. Yeah, you did. Had to. Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft. Yeah, you did. Had to. It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices. Yeah, you did. That wasn't one. CREDIT TITLES At the chiroposdist's. So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me. Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm. Ooh, two tragedies in one day. The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done. Hey. Hey. How was your day? Good. Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was? No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight? You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time. Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter. Robin! What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster. You should work at a suicide hotline. And then it got ugly. What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like Die Hard. But Field of Dreams? Once is more than enough. So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is Field of Dreams? It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid. So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie. Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie. At MacLaren's. How do you not like Field of Dreams?! At the chiropodist's. Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI. I guess I don't know how to do that. Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop. No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you? What the hell comes before "Q"? At MacLaren's. Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter. Can we talk about something else? You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up. Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties? That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck. Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing. I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job. Your job's not boring. Robin thinks so. Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God. I love it when you quote Scripture. I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies. Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever. That's 'cause you're always like...  "Ted Mosby, architect". Anything sounds impressive when it's said with the right attitude. Marshall Ericksen. Recently dumped and heading to a lame party. Whoa. Whoa, ladies, please take it easy. There's enough of me for everyone. Oh. Hi. Hello. All right. We're gonna take off.. Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. "Ted Mosby, architect". Trust me. Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that? Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol? Solid point. She did have hair of gold. Yes, she did. Mm-hmm. Later, Robin and Lily arrive at MacLaren's. Hey, Carl, is Ted still here? No. Hey, Lily. You still single? Yes. You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot. Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade sex for beer? Only if you're into it. It's on me. Thanks. I wonder where Ted went. Ted Mosby, the architect? Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier. And what made you decide you wanted to become an architect? Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess. I bet you can draw, can't you? You should draw me. Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right? Yeah. He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay? Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part. What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out. I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat. She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face. All right, we'll swing by the party. Now the party was for some of Marshall's classmates from Columbia Law School, who by day were some of the sharpest and most serious young legal minds in the country. By night, however... At the party. Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers. Okay! Seriously... Who wants to shave my ass?! That guy went on to become a Supreme Court justice. Okay, where are the guys and the hooker? Yo, what's up, ladies? Welcome to the party. Yeah! Just need you to sign this release protecting the host from any and all responsibility should you harm yourself or a third party. Then freakin' rage! Yeah! Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted. You mean Ted Mosby, the architect? Man, what a visionary. Yeah, they were here. Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building. Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you. I know you would. It's the job. Dude. You should let us shave your ass tonight. No way. Hey, Marshall, where's Lily? I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up. Her name wasn't on your lease, was it? 'Cause if not, New York state law, you're not obligated to give her half the deposit when you move. Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys. And don't forget the precedent set by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74. Any personal effects she left in your house or dwelling become yours after 30 days. Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now. You should sue her. Uh, really? On what ground, Kara? On the grounds of... shut up. That's our Attorney General. See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum. Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her? The girl with the smackable ass. Yes, that's the young lady. So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing? Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs. Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing. Yay! Wait, let me just check with my friend. Okay. Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s? Um... only always. Let's go. Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to sex. Did you grow up in that Footloose town? I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories. Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine. He's not answering. Calling Marshall. Hello. Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted? Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working. Uh, okay. Bye.  Marshall just lied. Ted's cheating on me. In front of a club. Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating bastard. You're going to need to refresh my memory. Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory? Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory. Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that. So these guys... One of them's an architect. Ted Mosby, the architect? That's the one. Oh, yeah, he was here. And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time." And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career. I live across the street. That is one hell of a non sequitur. You want to come over? Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. I'll see you at book club, Vinny. Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités. Nice. Giddy up! Dude, dude, what are you doing? Galloping. You proved it, all right? The whole "Ted Mosby, architect" things works. Architects rule! Whoo-hee! Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted. It is tonight. Whoo! You know this girl. Where does she live? I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks. Well, I'm out of money. I'm cashed, too. I'll take your purse. My purse? Yeah, my girl likes clutches. Okay, fine. You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot. Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my gun. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live? The building with the green light, apartment 3-C. Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass? Yeah... And steal her purse. In a building. I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you. 3-C, let's do this. You ready? Should I just kick the door in? Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin? I'm the problem. What? You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater. Well, don't stand out here and beat yourself up. Get in there and beat Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted. Let's do this. Bring it. What do you think you're...? Barney? Thank God you're here. Can you help with this? I need nails. Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted? Ted? He's at work. How did you get here? Awesome story. As per usual. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol? Solid point. And she did have hair of gold. Yes, she did. Sorry, I forgot my binocs for Foxy Boxing. Whoo, looks like things just got a little foxier right here. Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands. Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings. Yeah, stay Excuse us for one second.  Okay, you were right - the architect thing totally works. But I've got a girlfriend and I've got to get back to work. This project is getting harder and harder. Yeah, you did. Yeah, had to. See ya. Sorry, my, uh... intern had to leave. Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way. Ted Mosby... Architect. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building. Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up! Dude, dude, what are you doing? Galloping. All right, you proved it. The whole "Ted Mosby, architect" thing works. Architects rule! Whoo-hoo. Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted. It is tonight. And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here. But why would you use Ted's name? I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole "using my real name" thing. Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay. Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid. This is how people act in relationships. And that's why I avoid relationships. Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it. And thus ended this chapter of, "Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand." Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower. You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye? I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a "A." A... A... I'll just put "resident." Go, go, go, go. Robin took a long walk that night. She thought about how opening yourself up to another person usually means opening yourself up to going a little crazy. She thought about how much easier it was just to be alone. And then she came to see me. Ted's office. Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly. Thanks. So, uh... how was your night? It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours? You really want to hear about boring architect stuff? Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of Field of Dreams. I fell asleep half way through. What? The best part's the last 20 minutes. Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect? Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate? Obviously. Wow. Yes. You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger. You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think? You know that time we went to Spokane and I pointed out that skyscraper? That was the first building I ever designed. Wow. Ted, this is amazing. Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything. I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. Anna's apartment. Anna's reading the letter Barney left. "Dear Resident... The time we spent together, however long it was, meant the world to me. I would love to see you again, but unfortunately, I cannot. You see, I am a ghost. I can't only materialize once every decade on the anniversary of my death. I chose to spend my one day among the living with you, sweet... Resident. Perhaps we will meet again in another decade, provided you keep your figure. Until then, all my love from the beyond. Barney." Barney? Who the hell is Barney? In Barney's bed,  Lily and Barney wake up. Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! It's a pretty good story. And believe it or not, alcohol did not play a role. It all started two weeks earlier at Lily's housewarming. Lily's apartment. Welcome to my new home. Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it. Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice. Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen? Or a stove in your bathroom? a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator. Stovenkerator. Isn't that futuristic? God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed. It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so... Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason. Hold on, I got it. That was "something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey. Uh. Other cultures! Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...?  Aaaaaah! CREDIT TITLES At MacLaren's. Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon. I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic. Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that. What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch. The fortress of barnitude? No way. Come on. She's desperate. Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass. One of you guys is very, very lucky because I have... A boom! An extra ticket to the Alanis Morissette concert. Who's in? Absolutely not. No. Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch! Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone. Oh, you don't think I've tried? Table for one. One... Couple? Um, no, just me. Really? For brunch? You're right. Who am I kidding? Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow? Of course, sweetie. Can I go with you guys? Really? For brunch? God, I hate being single! At Barney's apartment. Okay,I'll take the over on the Pittsburgh game. Oh and P. to the S., I never got my payout from Seattle from two weeks ago. Yeah. Don't make me call the gaming commission on you. I'm sure they'd be very interested to know what's going on over there. All right? All right? Okay, I love you too Mom. Take care.  Hello Lily. You've somehow managed to circumvent my security. How did you do it? Ted gave me your spare key. Spare key! Brilliant! I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and... Sveikas That's terrible. Well, see ya. Wait, can I stay here maybe? I'd let you, but I don't have any room. You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits. Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry. Ewww! ...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives. Wow, you really are desperate. I really am. Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything. Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV. See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong. It hurts my eyes. Yeah. That doesn't go away. At the apartment, Marshall arrives. Hey, where have you been? The Alanis Morissette concert. By yourself? No,actually I went with a friend from law school. Oh,really? Who's this friend? Brad. Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks! Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight. you bought the tickets for you and Lily right before she dumped you. Yeah, how'd you know? I just got dumped myself. What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch? You invited him to brunch? Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird? Yes. That's why I was all "you invited him to brunch?" Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch? Because brunch is kind of... Girly. Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly? I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn. I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch. At Barney's apartment, Lily cooks breakfast. Uhm, smells delicious. Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up...  What are you doing? Lily, what was the first rule again? "Don't change anything"? And what was the second rule? There was no second rule. Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it. I bought groceries. That counts as changing something? King-sized bed, full-sized blanket, one pillow. Everything about this bed says "our work here is done." Next we say bienvenue to the bathroom. What, only one towel? What, no hairdryer? You know where I keep that stuff? Your place. Beat it. And the coup de grâce... Yeah, that's right. Patent-pending. And wilkommen to the hallway. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their porn... Marshall doesn't have porn. Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their porn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough. And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper. No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me. At Popover Pantry. God, I love brunch. Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ridonculous. This isn't weird, right? I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny. Right? Right? I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style? Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying. This must be destiny. What are you talking about? I have two tickets for Mamma Mia! friday night. You like Abba, right? What am I saying?Who doesn't? Anyway, I was gonna take Kara, but now it's all you and me. We're gonna do Broadway, bro style. What do you say? Yeah! At Barney's apartment, a girl watches him sleep. Hey. Did the cold wake you? No,I've just been watching you sleep. Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel. I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day. Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to... I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day. I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look  Oh, I'm disgusting. Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you. Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um... Barney... Oh! Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife? What? No. Yes! Yes? Yes. You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple. Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...?  You're not going anywhere. Live claritin clear. Wow, that was close. That hippie chick wouldn't leave. She was ready to squat here. Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she? She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than porn. Thank you. How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles... I'll do it. Really? Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win. I'll take it. Mamma mia!? Mamma mia!. You know what? It's supposed to be a great musical, okay? It won all sorts of Tonies and stuff. No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date. Ooh, third date. You know what that means. It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show. You bros going to get dinner beforehand? We might grab a steak, yeah. Where at? Café l'amour.  Brad says the food is really good there, okay? Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your "A" game. That means no granny panties. All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway. What are you going to wear? I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin...  Oh, you know what? Shut up. At Barney's apartment, Barney takes breakfast with a girl. Can you pass the arts and leisure?  Can you pass the arts and leisure? I just did. Honey, I'm... Barney, what the hell is going on here? Lily, I can explain... How could you? In our own home?  You bastard! I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had... Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I...  I was just about to turn on the tears. Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back. Yeah, that I just always wanted to do. Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change. You know... Oh nah, never mind. What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything. Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here. What did you have in mind? At the apartment. Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning. Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird. Oh, you really don't have to do that. No, I insist. You're my guest. Thanks, Brad. Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. Woah! Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap. It gets worse. No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you. So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come? You want me to go to a wedding with you? Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like "Wedding crashers". Just keep Brad away from the bouquet. It gets worse. It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc. Vermont? Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&amp;B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro. You said no, right? Of course. I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much. I'll go to Vermont with you. That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat. I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore. Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right? Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch. Break up. You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it . Good man. In Barney's bedroom, Lily and Barney put pillows on the bed. Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets. Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl? Oh. Ooooh! All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight? Oh, I was just going to watch "Letterman" but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here.  Okay, seriously, what do you do for a living? Please. I thought you were going out. Eh. After the monologue. The next morning, as the sun rose over Manhattan, your Uncle Marshall headed over to Brad's apartment to leave for the wedding in Vermont. But when he got there... No. No... No. No! No!  Ted.  Um, Brad got me flowers. Hold on. Oh, hey... No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would... Hey,sweetie. Hey. Aww. Hey, Marshall. Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now? Yeah. Happened last night. Uh, I'm sorry, bro. I should have called you. Yeah, you should have. Well, I didn't mean to hurt... Don't, Brad. Just don't. Oh, what was with him? I don't know. I think he's in love with me. In Barney's bed, Barney and Lily wake up. Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaah! I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done? Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep. "Just went to sleep"? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will. Hey,it takes two to cuddle. We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch "Letterman", and then slept together and didn't have sex? Oh my God! We're in a relationship! That's what you think a relationship is? You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go. Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you. Uh-uh. You gotta go. Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living. "A certain standard of living"? You didn't pay a single... And so Mr. and Mrs. Stinson, after two weeks  of marriage, decided to call it quits. Fortunately, they reached a settlement. And that's the story of how Aunt Lily furnished her apartment. Marshall ran into Brad again some time later. Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. That was great. Right? Right? Hey, Marshall. Oh, hey, hey, how's it going? It's good.  Hey, I'm uh... Yeah, I know who you are. Well,I got to go. I got this thing. Yeah, me too, but more important. So, I guess I'll see you around. Sure. Sure.  Even if you don't believe it, tell me he looks fat. Totally looks fat. Robin's apartment. It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion. And she did find it. I'm going to be a life coach. In fact, she found it again and again. I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper. Her newest lifelong dream? Singing in a punk rock band. What is she doing for money through all this? Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau. Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits? No. Big Wave Luau. Here she comes. Here she comes. Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap. I'm sorry. Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. . What do you want? I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau. Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo. I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name? No. My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks. Robin, nothing to add? No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams. Thank you. Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday. CREDIT TITLES MacLaren's. I've never need the beer more than I do right now. I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, "dude, my semester is gonna be this." Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid. Really? Laid, you say? You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s. She hot? Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah. And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar. A what? A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man. What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle? Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge. I didn't challenge you to have sex with... Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins. So, I quit my job. I just couldn't take it anymore. Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei... Classic. Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office? Yeah. Somebody did just quit. So, where should we eat today? Dude, that is cold-blooded. It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone. Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her. It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides? Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted. So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job? What would I be doing? Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant. Ted's office. You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client. Oh, right, is that the...? Yeah. Here's the model. You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant penis. I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it. How can he not see it? I mean there's the... I know. And the way it... I know. And the two little... I know. It is just... Spectacular? Why, thank you. Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant. Ah. Nice to meet you. Isn't it? Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony. Tell me, do you want to be an architect? I, uh... I am an architect. Really? Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with legos. Is he an architect? Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams. Ted, you've got promise. But you have to study what I do more carefully. Now I want you to design some styrofoam trees for the building model. Think you can handle that? Absolutely. So you're going to design the... Styrofoam trees. Once again, with feeling. Styrofoam trees. Styrofoam trees! Styrofoam trees! That's the spirit. Now, gather 'round. This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life. And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right or you're fired, hmm? Man, that guy is a total, well... Marshall's law school. Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there. Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce.  See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin. Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor. a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty? Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar. Scusi, I am Luigi, italian exchange student. I was, uh, walking to class, but then I noticed you... Bella principessa... Tell me what you want or get out. Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you. Turn around. My place. Two hours. Don't be tardy. MacLaren's. I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating. crotchety. . All right stop. Did you show lily your design? No. What design? It's nothing. It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia. Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers. Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it.  All right, enough! Pr Lewis' apartment. Oh, my god. Incredible. Hmm... C minus. C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter! You didn't budget your time well, you glossed over some of the most important points, and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive. Ted's office. Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed. Okay, I'm done. Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him. Great. Thanks. Well, finally. I wondered whether you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are. Too green. Too green? Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color. Almost brunette. And think bushier. I want this tower to rise from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery. Can you picture it, Ted? I can't un-picture it. Good. Oh, my God! It's gone! What? What's gone? My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose. Well, it's got to be around here somewhere. What do you think, Ted, it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away? Somebody stole it. Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees. Oh, who cares about the trees? It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing. Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? MacLaren's. Hey. Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer? That's easy. I took it. Why? It's simple. I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef. I guess you were sick the day they taught that at sandwich university Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you. I didn't get you a birthday present. What? You gonna cry? Huh? Little crybaby's going to cry? Hey, everybody, look! The little crybaby's gonna cry! I lost my ice cream! Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball. What does his ball have to do with anything? Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean. Hey, guys. What's going on? Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose. Why? Was he being mean? You know about this? Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap? Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis. I gave them to you for your birthday. So I've been walking around in stolen khakis? I prefer to call them "justice khakis." That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime. So is being mean. Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball. Well, that's why I left a note. A note? Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas. Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with. I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball. At the apartment. I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus. I know, I know. You claim to have so much sex. I only assumed  you'd be good at it. Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again. Just let it go, man. You're making things worse. I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master. Pr Lewis' apartment. I think I'm falling in love with you. Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it? Although that would explain a lot. What? No.We had sex yesterday. Oh, right. That. Well, you had sex yesterday. I revised my syllabus for the spring semester. Ted's office. When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, "who wants espresso?" So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball. No. What do you mean, no? I mean I stand by what I did, Ted. Come on, Lily. We're running out of time. Everybody get in here now! "Who wants espresso?" Now, as most of you know, my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen. Well, I just found this note. "Dear mr. Druthers,I, your baseball, am leaving. Maybe, if you start being nice, I'll come back. If not, other things in your office may follow my lead. In fact, I overheard your iPod talking, and he may shuffle off at any minute." Normally, I would scream at everyone until my voice goes, but maybe that's the wrong reaction here. Interesting. Instead, I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day to decide he's homesick, or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour. And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well, then you are gambling more than Pete Rose - major league baseball's all-time hit leader, a man whose absence from the hall of fame is a travesty to the entire sports world - ever "allegedly" did! Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod. Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired. No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time. This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back. All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans. No. You'll give it back or you're fired. I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that. Then you're fired. Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now. MacLaren's. Dude, you're killing me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier. Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up. So you're going back over there? Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the "cougar" once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name. Pr Lewis' apartment. I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance. Barney, I teach all day. It's the last thing I want to do when I get home. But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year. Fine.Come in. You can start while I finish grading some papers. Ted's office. Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment. Now, slide it closer to his chair. I want this thing to really smack him in the face. Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily. Oh. Well, I pity her. I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note... You might say that Lily was mentally deranged. You might say that, Ted. Lily was mentally deranged. You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear. Lily was mentally deranged! Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted? The clients are here. Excellent. Bring them in. Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane. They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured the distinct flavor and history of the northwest. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Spokane national bank building. That's a penis! That's... that's ridiculous. There's no way this majestic tower can be confused with the male organ of love. We're not building a penis. You got any other ideas? Other ideas? You said you wanted Hammond Druthers. This is Hammond Druthers. Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here. The trajectory of my entire career might have been different had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day. Wait! We have one more idea for you. Ted, what are you doing? I have another design. Sit down, shut up right now. No. MacLaren's. To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably! Probably! Congrats, ted. Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you. Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in. Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back... No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up. Lily's kindergarten. Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice. Hospital. Barney! Oh, my god! What happened? He broke his hip. That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine. No, he's not fine. Professor Lewis, hi. Mr. Eriksen. Hello. I graded your paper tonight. I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, she was. B plus. B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that "A"! Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived. It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides! So, I guess that decides it. Yup. Hanging out at a coffee place is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar. Man, what's that? What? That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name. Somebody has a crush on you. Somebody thinks you're me. Do you really think she likes me? I mean, I guess it's not that surprising. Every time I come in here, I totally crack her up. Marshall, here's your pumpkin latte. Wow. How did you fit a pumpkin in this little cup? I'll have a pumpkin latte. How do they even fit a pumpkin in those little cups? What? You got a shrink ray back there? Yeah. Hey, remember that time I said that thing about how do they fit a pumpkin into that little cup? Which time? The first time. Yeah. That was really funny. Right? All right, there's only two reasons she'd laugh at that. One, it's the first joke she's ever heard, or two, she likes you. You should totally ask her out. You think? Yeah, that's why you're not back with Lily, right? So you can experience what it's like to be single. Well, what if the heart doesn't mean anything? What if she writes it on all the cups? Mine says "Ted," no heart. Mine says... "Swarley." How'd they get "Swarley" from "Barney"? It's not even a name. Who would ever be called "Swarley"? Oh, please don't start calling me "Swarley." This would never happen at a bar! Man! What's up with Swarley? I know. You almost never see old Swarlz get that upset. CREDIT TITLES Robin's apartment, Robin is on the phone. Hey, guess what? Oh, sorry. It's only my mom. She's just rambling on like always. What happened? Marshall asked out a girl. Wow.  Well, if anything, that's Dad's fault. That'll keep her going a while. Oh, of course, you know, he had a little help. Swarley hooked him up? Oh, good. You got my text. Yeah. Oh. No, it was me. I gave Marshall one of my secrets. So, what she say? Nothing. I don't think she heard me. It's pretty busy up there. What? You gave her the look right? Head down, eyes looking up, hands in pockets, shoulders up, head slightly tilted, conveying shy vulnerability. I think so. Look, can we just go? Pumpkin latte for Marshall. I didn't order that. Phone number. I love that look. I think I slept with you because of that look. And it's fake? Oh, and you biting your lower lip, shyly looking away and thrusting your chest out is natural? Yeah, I hear you. Hey! Hey, guys. Are you free tomorrow night? I was thinking of having a wine tasting slash "help me catch the rat in my apartment" party. That's a great idea. You can put out cheese for both. I should invite Marshall, right? It'd be weird if I didn't. Yeah, I don't think he can go. Really? Why not? Uh, okay, um... Lily, we have to tell you something. Marshall has a date. Oh. Well... good for him. Really? You're okay with it? Look, we've been broken up almost six months. I mean, I'm not thrilled about the idea, but he has every right to date someone else. That's very mature. Why are you holding the phone? Oh, shoot.  That's hilarious, Mom. Didn't even notice. MacLaren's. Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit. Tell me about the fabric. Is it foreign or something? Wow. It is foreign. I'm impressed, Ted. It's Moroccan, actually. Whoa. I got a call for Swarley. Is there a Swarley here? You weren't interested in my suit at all, were you? Swarley! Yeah, I know he's there. It's really important. Could you ask again? Important call for Swarley! Geez, can't you hear him, Swarley? There's a call for you. Stop calling me that. Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe. Hi. Hi. Hi. It's nice to meet you guys. I'll be right back. It's right back there. Right? Right? She's hot! And she likes me? She likes Italian food. I also like Italian food. She likes Billy Joel. I also like... music. And I think we're going to go out again. Dude, you gotta ditch her. Obviously. Why? She's got the crazy eyes. Dude. The eyes. They're crazy. What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes? It's a well-documented condition of the pupils, or pupi. No. Just pupils. It's an indicator of future mental instability. She does not have the crazy eyes. You just can't see it because you're afflicted with "haven't been laid in a while" blindness. She was too far away in the coffee place, but when I saw her up close just now... Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe. Hi. Hi. Hi.  It's nice to meet you guys. Guys, I'm not going to stop dating Chloe just because you think she has the crazy eyes. You can keep going out with her, but you're gonna regret it. One time, I met a girl at this very bar. I saw that she had the crazy eyes... But I ignored it. And then, sure enough. Barney, can I ask you a question? Anything. Would you like to have a threesome? Of course. Great. It'll be you, me and Mr. Weasels. So, did you do it? No. It ended up being just a twosome with the third one watching from a chair. Which one were you? I'd rather not say. Look, there was a time I didn't believe in the crazy eyes either, and then I met Jeanine. She had serious crazy eyes. I told myself I was just imagining it, but then... So, should we go get a drink? As long as it's in your apartment. Whoa, I'm sorry. Watch! Where! You're! Going!  So, where do you live? You guys, Chloe is not  gonna do any of that stuff. She's a nice girl from Nebraska. She's not crazy. She's... she's awesome. But you can't avoid the crazy eyes forever. Sooner or later, the crazy  comes bubbling to the surface. Marshall's school law. Hello? Marshall, it's Chloe. Are you the one who's called me like nine times? Yeah. Could you come get me? I'm in the middle of taking a test. Please. I'm so scared. Well, what's going on? This weird midget guy started following me  and he was screaming at me and he had a limp and a big hump on his back and the police didn't believe me and I almost got trampled by a horse and... God I must sound totally crazy to you right now. No. Pfft. Not at all. MacLaren's. So, she's needy crazy. That's one of the worst kinds. I've had one of those. Makes up stories to get attention. Went out with her for three weeks, her dad died twice. Guys, she was really freaked out, okay? Maybe the story is true. What in the world would make you believe that's a true story? She's really hot. They always are. You all done with that, Ted? Yeah. Ned. I told you to call him Ned. That's just sad. Sorry, Swarley. The apartment. So, do just you and Ted live here or does Swarley live here, too? Nah. Swarley has his own place.  What was that? Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys. So, here you go. Two pumpkin beers. I was joking. They're regular beers. What is that? This picture is broken. Oh. That's too bad. Is that Lily? Is that the girl you were going to marry? Yeah. Is that what that sound was? Did you just smash this? No. Why would I do that? Let me look into your eyes. Okay. I had a really nice time tonight. Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking. I like your eyes a lot, too. Stooooop! Hi. I'm Lily. Stooooop! Now, kids, I know Lily hiding in the apartment while Marshall was on a date with another girl seems pretty crazy, but when you hear her side of the story, well, it's still pretty crazy. MacLaren's, 3 days earlier. What's up Swarlz? No. Okay? No. No more. I will not let this become a thing. It's over. No more Swarley. No Swarlz. No more Swar-lay. No more Swar... wait for it... ley. No more Bob Swarley, man. No more. No! It's over. Do you understand? Yes. Yes. Thank you. Nice. Why didn't you call me? Was I supposed to call you? Yes, about the whole Marshall-dating-another-girl thing. You said you were fine with it. Yeah, in front of Ted, but then I shot you a look. What look? This. That doesn't seem like a look. Yes it is. It means,  "I'm upset call me later." You should have pulled me aside and told me what the look meant. If I pulled you aside, I wouldn't need the look. Well, maybe if it was a more distinctive look... Okay, the look isn't important. What's important is that I can't stand the idea of Marshall dating another woman. I mean, what if he falls in love with her? Well, if it makes you feel any better, Ted says she has the crazy eyes. What's that? Apparently, a thing women have that guys can see and it tells them that the girl's crazy. Oh, kind of like how you never want to date a guy with perfect fingernails? Jerk nails. Exactly. Well, did Ted say whether she was good-looking? I mean, 'cause if I knew she was ugly, then maybe I wouldn't be so freaked out. Uh, he didn't say, but you can find out. I think her name is Chloe, she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th. Phone call for Swarles Barkley? Hey, Ted. No, he's not here. Good one, though, remember that one. Coffee place. Is, um, Chloe here? She just left. You can probably still catch her. She's easy to spot, she's got a pink umbrella. Oh, thanks, Brian. My name is Scott. Your tag says Brian. I know. Funny story. So, I wake up this morning, and... Yeah, see you later, Brian. MacLaren's. She's hot? I'm so sorry. No, it's fine. It just makes things easier. Now that I know she's a threat, all I have to do is keep Marshall from ever seeing her again. Okay, I have two plans, you can help me choose. Plan A) remember that time Marshall and I had sex in the bathroom? Oops, I got knocked up. Lily. Okay, plan B) is called "Chloe's Accident." Just stop. What? Lily, you can't do any of those things. If you two are ever gonna get back together, you have to let him work out whatever this is. I know. You're right. 00. Some surprise for Barney. Barney? Uh, Swarley. The apartment. Hey, guys. Hey. Where's Marshall? Oh, he's getting a haircut. Oh. For his date. Good for him. Hope he has a good time tonight. Relax, you've got nothing to worry about. The girl's crazy. Thanks! He'll just have wild monkey sex with her five times, max, and be done with her. Thanks again. What are you doing? I just wanted to listen to a little music, that's all. And this next one's going out to Swarley. All your friends know you miss Barney, but he's gone, and you got to accept that, baby. And, Swarley, you're gonna be  a better woman for it. Here's "I Am Woman" by Helen Reddy. Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it! You know, I was thinking about this whole new name thing last night, and you know what I realized? I like it. You like being called Swarley? Are you kidding? I want you to call me that. Do you really think this is gonna work? Do I think what's gonna work? I'm just saying, I love my new name, so please only call me that from now on. Call you what? You know, that-that-that new name that you've been calling me. Say it. Why? You guys know what it is. Say the name. No, I don't want to! I hate it! I hate it! It's not funny! It's never been funny! I've never done any... No! Man, he is really gonna lose it when all the magazine subscriptions start coming in. I signed him up for People in Espanol, but I addressed it to Swarlos. Hey, where's the picture of Marshall and me at the pier? Didn't it used to be by that window? Oh, yeah, he, uh, he sort of took it down when you left. Put it behind some books, I think. Oh, well-well, maybe I should put it back up. Why, so Chloe'll see it and get scared off? No. So Marshall'll see it and feel guilty. Yeah, okay. But she wasn't okay. Later that night, while Marshall was on his date, Lily came back. ...anymore. Pretty impressive, huh? Wow, you really did memorize all the lyrics to "We Didn't Start the Fire." Can I, uh, can I get you a drink? I'd love a beer. You got it. Lily did what any sensible woman would do. She hid under the desk. And she stayed there, listening to her ex-fiance on a date with another woman. I had a really nice time tonight. Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking. I like your eyes a lot, too. Finally, much like Billy Joel, she couldn't take it anymore. Stooooop! Hi. I'm Lily. Lily... Lily, what the hell are you doing? I don't know. I... I don't know... what I'm doing. Oh, pumpkin beer, that was a good one. I'm just... I'm gonna go. I... I'm so sorry. Enjoy the rest of your date. She seems nice. Out, building steps. Lily, what the hell... I'm sorry. I only snuck up there because... When I saw how cute she was yesterday, I freaked out. Lily, you saw her yesterday? Yeah, I... kind of chased her down the street. Wait, so you were the hunchback with the limp? Yeah. And she didn't break the picture, I did. So Chloe's not crazy, she's... just a nice, normal girl. Yeah, she is. And you deserve a nice, normal girl. So, why don't you just go back up there and finish your date. Yeah. Okay. Wait, if you were the hunchback, then why did she think you were a guy? I-I might have used a voice that sounded like this. Why? Because I didn't want her to know it was me, which I now realize doesn't make sense, because she hadn't even met me. You're crazy. You have... crazier eyes than anybody that I have ever met. Shouldn't you be going back up... I mean, you're out of your mind. You're... just absolutely insane. Shouldn't you be going back upstairs? I've missed you so much. Okay, I ran it by the group, and we decided we're gonna give you a choice. We will agree to stop calling you Swarley, but instead, we'll call you Jennifer. Well? I'm thinking. How about this? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, you... Hey! Look at this. So right there, in the exact same place that six months earlier I had walked up and found Marshall alone, crying over his breakup with Lily, I found him again. Only this time he wasn't alone, and he was happy. So we went to the bar to celebrate, and it was great. I was with Robin, Marshall and Lily were back together, and Barney had a cool new name. All was right with the world... Until we got back to the apartment. The apartment. Everything is upside down. Oh, my God. Hey, Chloe, I... guess I forgot I left you up here. I was gonna leave, but I can't find my keys. They're right there on the coffee table. Silly me. I must have looked everywhere else. Well... I'm just gonna go. Oh, I don't think we've met. I'm Chloe. Robin. It's nice to meet you, Roland. I'll see you guys later. Roland? Your name's Roland. That's funny, right? Rock and Roland. Warsaw is the capital of what? Roland. You're Monica Roland-ski. Hey, yeah, that's just how I Roland. Nice try, Swarley. Damn it. MacLaren's. Barney arrives. Swarley! Song, "Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name. And they're always glad you came... And so, after six months apart, Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together. Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious! Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer. Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight? Yeah, sure. How about pancakes? And things were back to normal... Almost. You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes. Oh, uhm... I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna? Really? Of course, I love you. No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? "Do you still wanna?" That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying. Marshall Eriksen, will you ma... No, no, no, no, no, no. What?! You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech. Do you remember your proposal to me? I had a speech prepared. What do you want to hear? I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that. Marshall... You are good-looking... Thank you. Funny... Oh, thanks. Smart... And a few tears wouldn't hurt. Okay, would you freakin' marry me already? I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out. Yeah, right. CREDIT TITLES The apartment. Marshall and Lily straighten after they had sex on the kitchen floor. I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup. I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married! I know, I know. It was a moment of happiness, followed of course by a moment of total panic. See, when they called off their first wedding, Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task of telling his entire family. Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off. What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that? What do you call that? I think that that's a little strong. I can't even believe you would use a word like that. Geez, Grandma. Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I? It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you? God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today. Yeah... Metro News One station. Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you. Robin! Stop the news! What the hell? It's okay. They're my friends. We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us. Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work. It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight.  Hey, Mike... You can read, right? Yeah, I'm the best at reading. Let's go to Atlantic City! Yeah! Ted's office. You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about? I hope not because I plan on getting hammered. Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager. Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story? Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City! Yeah! Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate? You got it. Pedicure's place. Hey, guys. Wow. A pedicure. Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine. We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now! Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell? So are you in or not? Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done. No, we got to get going to the... Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here... So we all got a pedicure and then headed down... to Atlantic City. A casino in Atlantic City. Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old. And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady. Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend. You been here before? Oh, uh, once or twice. Barney! Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe. The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this? I'm ready. Let's get married. Yeah. Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married. Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey. Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit. Oh, really? Thanks. Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me. Done. I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. You guys want to go gamble? No, we got to go get the veil. Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one. Yeah, okay. No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy. Thanks. How are you feeling? Great, a little nervous. Yeah? Craps? Not that nervous. No, I mean do you want to play craps. Oh, yeah, definitely. Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show? What did you just say? Barney, no. Marshall, I'm your best man. You're not my best man. Right here. And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend. You're not my best friend. Right here. Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes. 18 minutes... 18 minutes later. Oh, good. Did you get the veil? Of course. And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club. Dude! Unbelievable! We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance. Your last lap dance ever. Right. What? Okay, I'm here. Right? Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City. Does it smell like strippers in here? That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married! Hell, yeah, look at this. Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing. Hi. We're here to get married. Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about. We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine. Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right? Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own. What? It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday. No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point. Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five. Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time. Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel. Have you been outside? There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana. You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this? About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. the bachelor party continues! Yes! Continues? You mean "start." He means "start." We went to a strip club. Twenty-seven. Is there any way that we could get a license today? You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason. Well, we're in love. What better reason could there be? The last one I heard was, "I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country," but, you know, give yours a whirl. So we went to the courthouse. Courthouse. God, this is taking forever. Can't believe they're getting married. I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City... Ted, up here. Uhm? You were just staring at my shirt boobs. No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt. Hey, it's Barney! Barney! Hi. Legen-...-dary! See you. What the hell was that? A... Chinese guy? Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love. Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now. Oh, really?! Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period, but unfortunately, only a judge can do that. Oh. Well, so can we see a judge? Absolutely. Really?! Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today, which there isn't. Why are you doing this to us?! 'Cause you're on Candid Camera! Really?! Is what I would say... You know what? We get it. In a corridor, on a bench. Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long. Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds. Vultures. Psst. What? Here? Yeah. Got a little time to kill. Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it? No. A little. Something is seriously wrong with you. So what, is that a no? All right, let's do it. All right. Um, also...? Yes, I'll leave it on. Sweet. Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen. Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative. You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that bullet. Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on! Judge's office. Lily turns on her musical bouquet. Turn it off. Okay. May we please get married today? Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that? What was what? That little look. What was that? A look of love. You two have stood together through thick and thin, right? You know, what's thick? what's thin? Yeah, I mean, all... yeah. I have. All right, what was that look? What's going on? They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sex in the closet. What? We're under oath. No, we're not. Yeah, we are. He's a judge. Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is? Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it. Casino. Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen. No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today. Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license. Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place. Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage? This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go.  Excuse me. Are you a ship captain? This is my machine. I should go talk to her. No, let me. Blackjack? Yeah. Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer. Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today? Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long. Nobody's gonna do that. No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight. Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt... Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain. What? Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that? See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us? I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000. What? Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it. I can get us that money. How? Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me? Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer? Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called "Shing Hasabu Shing". Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money. No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away. Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it. Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night, and I've been to a lot of casinos since, but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one. To this day, I have no idea how it was played. But luckily, Barney did. Do you understand what's happening? Not a clue. Do you think he's winning? I don't even know if he's playing. Wait, I get it. I understand this game. No, you don't. I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean. Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right. On the ship. Wow. It's beautiful. Thanks, Barney. Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling! When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay? Why can't I do it just a little? Okay. Let's get this started. Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one? Oh, I think. Serious would be best. You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that. Yeah, serious is probably good. "We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy..." This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married. I never said "never." "...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you." What was that? What was what? That little look. You two just shared a look. We don't want to do this. We don't. Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding? After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt? Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet? You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding? Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work. So do I. And yeah... My family  might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter. I love you, Marshmallow. I love you, too, Lilypad. I now pronounce you man and wife. What?! Is that not right? Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married. Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you. Unpronounce us! Unpronounce us! All right, I unpronounce you man and wife. Oh, whew... That was close. And that's the story of how Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily got married for 12 seconds somewhere off the coast of Atlantic City. The apartment. Hey, guys. Hey... Ted. Is Robin here? Man, I hope so. ...learn about relationships is that you're never done getting to know someone. Everyone has secrets. Some are nice. You know how to make crepes? That is so cool. INT. TED'S BEDROOM Some aren't as nice. And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to... Oh, I got your total...counting along... INT. MACLAREN'S And some are just weird. You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs? Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners? Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either. Why? Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email? No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt. Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are. Come on, let's go. All right, I'm in. To the Willowbrook Mall! To the Willowbrook Mall! Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going. What? Why not? I just don't feel like going to a mall. We can split a cinnabun. No, I'm really not gonna go. Come on, it'll be fun. No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls. Why not? I'd rather not say. Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy. Thanks Ted. INT. TED'S BEDROOM So, what's the deal with you and malls? You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to. Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall? No. Dumped in a mall? Ted. Found out you were Canadian at a mall? Let it go. Let it go. Mauled at the mall? Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure. OPENING CREDITS INT. MACLAREN'S What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls? Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment. The 'oh' moment? Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker. It's a promise ring. I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married. Oh. I don't have an eating disorder. It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it and then I spit it out. Oh. I just turned 30. Oh. So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible. I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative? I now pronounce you man and wife. I love you. I used to be a dude. Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets. You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox. It's true. They tell each other everything. I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you Try me. Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton? Doggie ate his pants. Yep. Bill's bachelor party in Memphis. Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach? OK, Seattle. Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch. Damn. I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert. Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything. So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway. What happened next? Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing. Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is? You know? Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do porn, wait for it, ography. Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous. I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down. Hey. What? The walls are thin. That's not what I'm hey-ing you about. You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married? Married? What does have to do with the mall? Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price... We're not getting married at the mall. Just meet with the guy. She's not married. Robin hates marriage. Because she already got married, at the mall. No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing? Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up. She's a pretty private person. Except when she's talking about... A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage. What do you think of this wedding cake? Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie. No. My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French. They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess. So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada? Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted. Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it. Thank you Barney. 'Cause it's porn. I need another beer. Robin is not in porn. I'll bet you anything that she's married. 20,000 says it's porn. I don't have 20,000. Well then, what do you have? Well. No. I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet. Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid. What the hell's a slap bet? Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings. You can be Slap Bet Commissioner. Oh, I love it. What are my powers? But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read "Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner." And your tombstone will read, "got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died." All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband? You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it. Yeah, you're right. INT. APARTMENT Husband. There's no 'p' in husband. Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands. Fine, I'll take it back. Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada. Huh. I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that? You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn. Just say, "no, I'm not married." Ted, I don't understand why you can't... Just say, "no, I'm not married." I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married. Oh. I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since. Why didn't you get divorced? He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough. Good ... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough. I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this. OK. INT. MACLAREN'S Your hand is monstrous. Well, what did you expect? You've seen my penis. I can't believe you told us Robin's secret. How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you. No I didn't. Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please. Fine, Robin's married. Ha ha ha. Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you? See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it? I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress. What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce? Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously. It's serious to me. You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school. I can see my hand print on your face. Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of porn from Canada I have to go through. I won the bet. Why are you still searching? Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong. Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch porn. Canadian porn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go "oat" of my mind. INT. APARTMENT Hey. Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney. Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it? Robin's not married. What? Then, why would she tell me she was? I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married. There must be some mistake. I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either. So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you. You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her. Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest. Thanks Ted. Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is. I say we just move on. June. We had a June wedding. Ah, Canada in June. That's great. Sit down or buffet. Um... Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember. No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc. Hm. Band of DJ? String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound. Seven. Azaleas. Color scheme? Dusty rose and sienna. Husband's name? Um. You were never married. Yes I was. No you weren't. How do you know? I looked it up at the library. What library? The one on 5th. When did you go? Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad.... I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use? I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000. Fine, Marshall looked it up in school. You told Marshall? You lied to me! See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret. But it was a fake secret. Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too. Testing me, that's insane. Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world? That wasn't a real secret. Yeah, but it could have been. You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong. He moved there for business. INT. MACLAREN'S You, you got something to say to me? I know Robin was never really married. How could you possibly know that? And then I put on my pajamas and got into bed. What about you? Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine... I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you. Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk. Barney gets three slaps. Three? One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps. No. You're gonna cry. INT. APARTMENT I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced. I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine. So I just got a very interesting phone call. What are you talking about? I know Robin's secret. What? 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now. Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this. Yeah. No I don't. What? Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret. Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now! Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing. Barney, don't, okay. Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right. No, Barney, I said we're not watching this. No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it. Are you as terrified as I am? I don't wanna get slapped again. I wanna stress that I was young. Yeah you were. And I didn't know any better. They never do. And it started out as an innocent modeling job. It always does. Please, Mr. Johnson, I'm sorry I was a bad girl. Please don't give me detention. Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you? Oh my God. Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock. What the hell was that? I slap bet Marshall that you did porn, so I win. Porn? I wish it was porn, it would be less embarrassing. I know, how about I sing you a song! Let's go the mall everybody! Come on, Jessica. Come on, Tori. I was a teenage pop star in Canada. Put on your jelly bracelets and your cool graffiti coat. At the mall, having fun is what it's all about. This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen. That's you? Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels. Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today. This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986? The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93. Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't porn. And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner. Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping. Went to the mall with a couple of friends. Had a whole week's allowance to spend. OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity. Cool. Go with the 10 now. No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5? Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy. I'm gonna go with the five for eternity. Good call. Horrible call. Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun. Let's go to the mall today! Everybody loves the mall So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today? I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket. Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone. You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice. Aw. That's one. Everybody come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Yes. There's this boy I like. Met him at the food court. He's got hair like Gretzky and he does jumps on his skateboard. I hope he asks me out. Take me to my favorite spot. It'll be just him and me. But don't forget the robot. The robot! Hey! But, baby, I don't wanna wait. No, she doesn't wanna wait. I'm gonna rock your body anyway. I'm going to rock your body 'til Canada Day. Everybody, come and play. Throw every last care away. Let's go to the mall, today! Today, today, today, today. Let's go to the mall ... Barney comes into the apartment. Okay. All-night rave, abandoned tire factory in Newark. We're on the list. Who's in? Later, Barney comes back.. Private jet. Teeterboro Airport, skinny-skydiving. Who's in? And again… One beer. Bar, downstairs, 15 second walk. Who's in? Shh... Lily went sleepy-bye. It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman. Barney is at the bar talking to a girl Hi. Have you met me? Finally, he decided to bring in reinforcements. Barney comes into the apartment. Yes. And do you know why? Hang on to your bedsores, grandparents from Willy Wonka, because guess who's on his way up to this apartment right now? My... wait for it... brother, James. React. He's exactly like Barney. That's what I just said. Well, Barney and his brother aren't exactly alike. James is gay. Really? I never in a million years would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome. Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up, so you don't act all surprised when he gets here. Someone knock on the door and Barney opens Barney Here he is. What up, New York. Thanks for the heads up. Générique How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother? Is he black? I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside rather than the color of their skin. I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face. Yeah, so now the wedding's back on. Anyway, James, how have you been? Awesome, as per "yoozh." I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary. And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals."Legendarier." And by now you've noticed the suit. go 'head, touch it. Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera, Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor who upon completing the very last stitch in this suit dropped dead, which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it. C'mon. Gimme five. Is "gimme five" back? Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning. Guys, "gimme five" is back! Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin. So, I have to ask, there's a story here. Please. Flashback – In 1982, Barney and James are kids and are sitting on the cough. The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of... different explanations from their mom over the years. Well, boys, you look different because when I was pregnant with you, I only ate vanilla ice cream. And when I was pregnant with you, can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate? In 1984 I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things. In 1986 Stop asking me! You  know what you two are? You're little racists! End of Flashback So what are you guys gonna do tonight? I'll tell you what James is gonna do. He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting. And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did. Ted... James is my wingman now. Okay. Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once, lucky twice, and... whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in? way more back hair than any guy who can afford laser hair removal should have. And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo. It was everything we ever dreamed of when watching Donnie and Marie. She was a little bit country. He was a little bit way into black guys. Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination. Since there was never any crossover in targets, James was always there for Barney with the assist. Flashbach. James and Barney are et the bar. Whoa. Your scarf... it is fierce! Thanks. H &amp; M. What? I would never know, 'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see. Hey! You know, speaking of things that would look good wrapped around you, have you met my straight brother, Barney? Oh, he is fab--don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay? And Barney always returned the favor. Help, I don't think he's breathing. Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth? Oh, my God, I do! Okay, great. How 'bout you instead? End of flashback. Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here! It has been forever since I have been around anyone even remotely fun. Uh, yes offense. You guys are still going out with us tonight, right? 00 and...I have warm soup belly. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys... you are young, attractive people here in the greatest city on earth. There  are boys and girls in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here. But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor, debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night in  the parking lot of the feed store or in some other dude's basement. You owe it to them to rise up and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot, and you go out there and you live their dream!- Can I get a "hell, yeah"? Can I get a "hell, yeah"? Can I get a "woo-woo"? Go do it for Wyoming! Yes! Testify! So that night, Barney got his wish. We all went out. They get into a bar. Daddy's home! Yeah. All right, bro. What do you like? Guy in super tight black T? Super tight black guy? Guy who looks like Mr. T? Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis. Let's focus on you, my man. I'm feeling lazy. How 'bout girl with the chocolatini? Oh... boom, back tattoo. Hero and the pig? Cool. Let me know if he bothers you again. Thanks. You should stay close... just in case. Sure. If it'll make you feel safer. I'm Barney. Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar, you can always tell the difference between the singles and the couples. You just have to look for the signs. Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability. Have you met my brother? Oh, hello. Have a drink. Nice to meet ya. Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house, are obsessed with finding a place to sit down. There are a lot of other indicators, too. From choice of social lubricant...to basic body language. But the point is, there are many ways to tell whether someone has Single Stamina or Couples Coma. I wish I would've worn sneakers. I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy who was periscoping out of his pleather pants. Permission to come aboard denied. I miss my jammies. I can't believe I wore a bra for this. Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural. Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo. Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe? Oh, please go sweat on someone else. Poor guy. Poor guy? Poor my boobs. Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl and you just crushed him. Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside. Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end. "Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks and have sex with me." Waa. "Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like, but  can't order because they'll be made fun of." Excuse me. Join me in a shot? Oh, no thanks. I've had enough. He's too in shape, we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it... because I can. You know, that was, like, the third hot guy that James blew off tonight. Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning, he's whining about his feet. He's as bad as we are. He is. Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is... in a relationship? No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother. Look at that. He's texting! Oh, my God! He is in a couple. This is gonna kill Barney. What's gonna kill me? What's going on? B-Barney? Have you noticed anything...different about James? No. I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean. We have reason to believe that James is, uh, maybe hiding something from you. I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but... Barney... your brother is...monogamous. That's ridiculous! Just because he's a little sleepy, and he hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall... He hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall. And, Barney... I hate to be the one to tell you this, but... he's texting. No, he... No! That... is impossible. Excuse... Excuse... Ex... Hey, bro. Don't change the subject. Let me see your phone. Why? I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone. No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone! And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it, and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing. It's so amazing how far technology has come. What kind of phone do you have? "I don't remember his name." That is Tom. And he's my fiancé. James meets Barney at McLaren’s Hey. I don't support this. Gay marriage? Not gay marriage-- marriage! How can you do this?We  were raised in the same house, with the same values! Believe me, I fought this for a long time. Come on, it's embarrassing. Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first. But I fell in love. And Tom and I realized you can't fight love. Oh, God. Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick. Okay, okay, look,I need you to wrap your head around this, okay? Because it is happening. And I want you to be my best man. What? No way. Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope you change your mind. James leaves Barney. Three girls come  in, one of them with a bridal veil. Two beers, one shot. Oh, it's a freaking epidemic. Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin are at the apartment. Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me? Yes. Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in? Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one. Okay, here's my thing. If gay guys start getting married, then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it. That's how it works. They start something, then six months later, everyone follows. Like now everyone gets manicures. I don't get manicures. Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed. You get your chest waxed? You know what I mean! Gay marriage is going to cause single life, as we know it, to die out. Think of how the American family will be strengthened. Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up and be a man about this. No. It's always been me and him together, being awesome, while the rest of you walked two-by-two onto your ark of sexless boredom. Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change. Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people. Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like. Sandals and socks--come on, buddy. But I took her out, we celebrated. It was the right thing to do. You got to support him. You're right, Ted. This is a cause for celebration. We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment he and Tom are about to make. Barney and james arrive at a gay bar with Marshall, lily, Ted and Robin. Yeah. This is where we're celebrating the commitment that Tom and I are about to make? What? Yeah! See, that cage represents your commitment. Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious. Hey. You work out? I do. And thank you for noticing. You're obviously in very good shape yourself. Well, I try. So you want to dance? You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively, you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiancée. I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I... No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers. No, it isn't. Whatever. How 'bout you? Oh, I'm straight, too. But I thank you for your time, and I appreciate your interest in my body. You see that? Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible. I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity. Hey, I really like your sweater. Wow. You actually do, don't you? You're not checking out my boobs or anything. My name's Gay Ken, what do you think? I love this place! Let's dance! Man- Damn. And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam! Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating, being able to talk about this to you. I cannot wait for you to meet Tom. And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend... this guy. Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink? Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay. All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down because they are in a gay club. You see that chick right there? She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player. Okay, I'm in. Which one am I? Please. He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go! I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable. Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone. Look at me, in a yummy sandwich! Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so... Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts? God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club, enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered? How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men? That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes. It's like, hello, my eyes are up here. And  it's never the hot ones. It's always the losers. Bums me out! Looks like the boys learned their lesson. Do you totally miss being hit on? Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar. James, James, since you like arts and crafts, look at what Charles here made with cherry stems. He did it with his tongue. Yeah. Barney. So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone, and once he's in a funner mood... Barney, Barney, I don't want his number. I don't want anyone's number, okay? I'm getting married. Wow.- Best of luck to you both. My number's in here. I'm very discreet. Okay, okay, excuse me. Barney, family talk. Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay? I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life... Oh, so now it's my way of life? I thought it was our way of life. You've completely turned your back on it. Look at you, not even suited up. Do you remember why we suit up, James? To get laid. To show people that we are different from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there. The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with, a two-person army that plays by its own rules. But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines, and you've abandoned me. Well, I'm not gonna let you do that. It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing! You don't have to do this, bro! Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby. What? There's gonna be a baby? Yes. We're adopting. Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle? For the rest of your life. Ted  And that's how Barney became Uncle Barney. A year later, at James's wedding, Barney could not have been more proud. At James’s wedding To James and Tom. May you have a long and happy life together. And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.- Cheers. Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase. No one wants to hear about that. It was perfect. You even made Tom's dad cry. Might have been doing that because he's a Republican. 00. We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab? Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer. Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all. All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home. Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat. Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic. Ted and Robin get up to dance. James stands un and leaves the baby with Barney. Hey, buddy. Your parents are married. Now, listen, you. Just because you're being raised by married people doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle. High-five. Luckily, you got me. In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21, and I will be... Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet. But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style. Stick with me, kid. I am gonna teach you how to live. Great suit, by the way. Who is the cutest? Barney talks with a woman. I don't get it. Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade. Why doesn't he like them now? Why? Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones? Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman who is worthy of love? Are you brave enough to hear that? You... She kisses Barney. her new boyfriend Clint, spend it with my dad and his new girlfriend micro-brewing, or head down to Staten Island to spend it with my super religious cousin Stacy and her family. So I opted for none of the above and decided to spend Christmas 2006 in Manhattan... celebrating with my other family. Lily is decorating the apartment while Marshall studies 00 p.m. today, so until then, I will be at the law library at school, but I'm not to be disturbed for any reason. Dude, open your eyes. You're going to hurt yourself. No, no. Christmas Eve winter wonderland is my reward for finishing my paper. Baby, do I smell your Sinfully Cinnamon Cookies? Yes. 00. Save me at least 20 cookies and do not clean the bowl. Was that a reindeer? I don't want to know! Hey, look. Our old answering machine. Oh, yeah. After you left, we, uh, we unplugged it because it reminded Marshall of how you used to, you know, leave messages. But hey, you guys are back together. I say we're plugging it back in. It's good to have you back. Thanks. Oh, hey, look, there's still some messages on here. Hey Ted, it's Dad calling to check in. I'm going fishing this weekend with my friend Clint, so if I don't hear from you beforehand, I'll talk to you next week. Yes, same Clint. Hey, Marshall. Are you lying on the couch right now moping about Lily? You are, aren't you? Well, stop it. She's not worth it. You gotta get over that Grinch. But I didn't say "Grinch." I said a bad word. A very, very bad word. Oh, fudge. But I didn't say fudge. I'm... a what? I-- That was Barney, that was Barney. That was you, Ted. That was Marshall. Marshall left a message for Marshall? You know, it may have been me, but it was so long ago. Man, that machine, it really garbles your voice.You know, it almost made it sound like I said... Why would you call me that? It was a fair question. Marshall's breakup with Lily had sent him into a deep depression and nothing could get him out of it. Until one day... Marshall is eating on the couch while Ted reads the newspaper. She was perfect. I lost the perfect woman. I should have knocked her up when I had the chance. Okay. That's it. You're never going to get over her until you stop putting her on a pedestal. So no more ice cream until you tell me one thing that's wrong with Lily. There's only one of her? Okay. She called off your wedding and dumped you to be a painter in San Francisco. What do you call that? Fiercely independent? Brave? I guess it was a little selfish. There you go. And in almost no time, that spark turned into a roaring fire. Flashback. Marshall, Ted and Barney are at the bar. Yeah. No, you're right. Lily would laugh at anything. She'd give it up for a bad pun. I'm telling you, she's a laugh slut. Remember that time we heard her laughing and we thought she was watching Weekend At Bernie's, but it turned out she was watching Weekend At Bernie's 2? And her art? "I'm Lily, I'm an artist." She doesn't even own a beret. Yeah, and if she's such a great "artist," why does she suck at Pictionary? Who draws a ninja star like a Star of David? Right, right? Yeah! Another round! End of flashback. Back at the apartment. I was trying to help him. I'm his best friend. That's the best friend's job. The best friend's job is to call me that word? Yeah. Barney, Robin and äTed are at the bar. Oh, Ted. Oh, Teddy boy. Why is this such a big deal? It's just a word. We use lots of words, every day. It shouldn't be any different than any other word. Then why don't you say it now? Grinch. You timed that didn't you? Perfectly. Well, at least you apologized. You apologized, didn't you? Oh, yeah. "I'm sorry" were the first words out of my mouth. Flashback. Lily and Ted at the apartment. I'm sorry, but I am not apologizing. I was just trying to put the guy back together. You smashed him to pieces. Are you seriously not going to apologize for leaving that message? No! Why not? Because, Lily, this summer, you were kind of a Grinch. Oh, you'll be sorry, Ted Mosby. End of flashback. Back to the bar. Ted Vivian Mosby! That's not my middle name. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth ? Like you've never said that word. I don't kiss your mother with my mouth. Yet. Are you sick? Is it sick to find maturity and experience sexy? No, I meant do you have a cold? I'm fine. I'm fine. My nose is just overflowing with awesome and I had to get some of it out. Now, if you'll excuse me, the holidays are a time when people are lonely and desperate. It's the most wonderful time of the year. I should go apologize. It's Christmas Eve. Yeah. I mean, slamming doors and screaming curses? If I wanted that, I would have gone home for the holidays. Barney talks to a girl. I don't see any mistletoe, but... Oh! Oh, God! Uh... "Bless you" would have been nice. Robin walks Barney home. On the Hallway. You're sick. I'm not sick. You're sick. You know what? I am sick. Sick of you telling me I'm sick. What up? Barney cough so strongly that he fells. Ahh... Three flights of stairs, not a drop spilled. Hey, buddy. You sure this is gonna work? Yeah, this is our thing. In college, whenever I wanted to make up with her, I'd buy her a beer. Cute, right? Totally. Plus free mug. Usually that would've done the trick, but it turned out this was a problem not even alcohol could solve. Actually the beer helped a little. She took the decorations. She took the decorations! What a Grinch! That time I did say "Grinch." All right. I guess I have to call her, right? Lily's cell phone. She'll listen to reason-- right? Oh, hey, Billy. Actually, funny thing--the voice dial got you. I was trying to call... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah, the holidays are a rough time for everyone, Billy. Okay, yeah, dinner next Wednesday. Okay. Damn voice dial. Barney! What the hell are you doing? Get in here, it's freezing outside. Are you insane? Hey, blame Lily and her oppressive "no cigars in the apartment rule." God, it's like Marshall's marrying the Taliban. . High five. Eww. No. You have to go home and get to bed. Oh, Robin, my simple friend from the untamed north, let me tell you about a little thing I like to call mind over body. You see, whenever I start feeling sick, I just stop being sick and be awesome instead. True story. Yeah, in two minutes, I'm going to pound a sixer of Red Bull, hop in a cab, play a couple of hours of laser tag, maybe get a spray-on tan. It's gonna be legen... Wait for it... Lily! Merry Christmas, assface. Um, Lily? Where are the Christmas decorations? At my apartment. You want to bring them back so we can celebrate Christmas together-- please? Ted, do you know what I would do if one of my kindergartners used that kind of language? I would be on the phone with their parents. Yeah, I'm not a kindergartner. Exactly. You know what that word means. You know that calling people names is mean and hurtful... assface. Lily, if you don't bring that stuff back right now, we... She hung up. She's just mad. She'll cool down. The phone rings Lily... Don't forget to take the cookies out of the oven... assface! Damn it! I could be in Cleveland right now making peppermint lager with my dad. Where are you going? Marshall gets home in three hours. He's gonna show up--no Lily, no winter wonderland.I gotta get up to the Bronx. Ted goes out slamming the door which wakes up Barney) ...dary. Ted’s on the street when his phone rings. Hey, dude, how's the paper going? Screw the paper, how's the winter wonderland? Is it magical? Oh... so magical. When you walk through the door, does it feel like you've been slapped in the face by Christmas? Sure does. Look, I gotta go. Come on, man, describe it! Tell me about the decorations. Is Rudolph there? He is, isn't he? Hi, Rudolph! Ah, yeah, but, you know... decorations, is that really what Christmas is about? Hell, yeah! What else would it be about? Uh, try the birth of Christ. You know, Christmas-- Christ Mas, which means "More Christ" to our Spanish friends. Yeah, well, all I know is walking in that door and seeing the winter wonderland and seeing Lily and all you guys, just... I can't wait. Right. I gotta go. Right. Okay.Oh, wait. Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted. One more thing. How about the cookies? Are they delicious? Robin is at the apartment with a fire extinguisher You know, honestly, they taste a little store-bought. Oh! I got another call. Well, tell Lily I love her. Right. - Hello? Ted Evelyn Mosby! Oh. Uh, hey, Mom. Merry Christmas. I just got the most disturbing call from Lily. How could you use such a horrible word? Oh, God, she called you? Are you acting out because of the divorce? Is-is this all about Clint? No, Mom, why would it be about Clint? Hey, buddy, it's Clint. How you doing, champ? Hey, Clint. Listen, um, I don't really have time to... Hey, hey, no, no, no. Ted, Ted. You don't know this yet, but you and I are going to be great friends. Now, the Native Americans have this ritual... Ted hangs up and takes the subway. Barney is in bed and Robin brings hm food. This is a low moment for the Barnacle. I should be off playing laser tag right now, but instead... Don't look at me. I'm hideous. You just look like a regular guy. Exactly. I'm a Ted. I'm wearing elastic-waist fleece pants. And isn't it more comfy? Yes. Come on, you need eat something. Too weak... to hold... bowl. Fine, I'll feed you. Ouchie in my mouth! I don't want it. I want ice cream. No, you're not having ice cream for dinner just 'cause you're sick. But my throat hurts. No ! I hate you! Robin stands up Don't leave me. Lily is at her apartment when someone knocks on the door. Who is this ? Pizza delivery. Hey, you tricked me. You really thought I was the pizza delivery guy? No, I knew it was you. I just thought you'd at least bring a pizza. Yeah, well, I brought a beer, but I gave it to a homeless guy. All right, he took it from me. Now, will you please come home? No, I'm not spending Christmas with you. Okay, I'm sorry for calling you a... that word, over the summer, and for saying it again today. And for thinking it a lot on the subway ride over. I had no right to say that. It was hurtful and immature and I'm sorry. Oh, shut up. You think I don't know your fake apologies by now, Ted Mosby? Huh? You're clearly still mad at me. I'm not mad at you. Yes, you are. I am not mad at you, Lily. Now, can we please just... I've apologized to Marshall and he's forgiven me and we've moved passed it. Why can't you? Because you never apologized to me. Marshall's not the only one you walked out on. You leave for three months, you don't even call. Come on, Lily, we're supposed to be friends! Yeah, some friend, you called me a Grinch. You were a Grinch! How can you... Grinchy, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch, Grinch. The light goes out Happy? Now, you've pissed off the big guy upstairs. Yeah, I'm sure God cares if I... You use that language again and I'll turn off your water! That's my super. He lives above me. Great. Thanks to your filthy mouth, now I'm going to have Christmas alone in the dark. Fine. I don't want to ruin Christmas. You can have the apartment. Don't worry about seeing me there I'll be in Staten Island with my cousin Stacy. Just.... Merry Christmas. Ted walks out lily’s apartment. You're spending Christmas Eve with your family? Baby, that sucks. I'm so sorry. Uh, they're fine. They're just... they're a little weird. You know they don't believe in gifts or Christmas trees. And they think Santa's how Satan spells his name when he wants to trick us. Well, do you want me to go with you? Was that a sincere offer? First tell me your answer. Stay there. Save yourself. We'll spend all day together tomorrow. Okay. Oh, how's Barney feeling? You mean the whiney bottomless pit of neediness? He was bugging me, so I spiked his echinacea tea with codeine. You're gonna be a great mom. Marshall walks into the apartment with a box. Holy crap, the magical Christmas season is upon us. And thank God we don't pay for utilities. Merry Christmas! What's in the box? Only the best present for the best girl ever. It took me all day to track it down. I thought you were writing a paper. Ah, naw, I blew that off. I'll get an extension. School's not important. What is that pitter patter on the roof? Could it be the sound of an awesome Christmas story about to come down the chimney? Why, yes, it is. 'Twas the day before Christmas... Flashback. Marshall is at the post office It was supposed to arrive, like, five days ago, but then it got lost and rerouted. I checked two other branches, finally they told me it was here. Yeah, all I needed to know was the tracking number. Looks like it's headed out to our regional branch in Poughkeepsie. What?No, no, no, no,I need that package today. Listen, the truck already left five minutes ago so unless you want to run after it... Marshall runs after the truck Stop! Stop! Stop, please, stop. Stop. Stop the truck. I need a package on your truck. Can I please take a look in back? Sure. But I gotta keep driving my route. I'm running behind. Marshall gets in the truck My bad. I'm okay.  Hey, man, thanks for helping me make my fiancee's Christmas. No problem. Too bad I can't deliver all these packages by the end of the day. Wait, so some people aren't going to get their gifts in time for Christmas? Sadly, no. Marshall helps the truck driver deliver the gifts. End of flashback. Back at the apartment We delivered every single package on that truck. But I still have one package left to give. Yeah, I did. Merry Christmas. Open it, Baby. Okay. Oh, my God. An Easy Bake Oven! I've wanted one of these ever since I was a little girl. In this exact model. I never told you that. How did you know? Flashback. A month earlier Marshall and Ted are in the bar. It's our first Christmas since we got back together. I want to get her something really special. So I'm getting her a jukebox. Wow, that's a great gift. Not really. It's this big and it dispenses gum. Oh, man, I know something you could get her that would blow her mind. Ready? Eight years ago... Flashback. Ted and Lily are in marshall and Ted’s college room. When I was a kid, all I wanted was an Easy Bake Oven. I begged and I begged, but all I got was a stupid Lego set because my feminist mom didn't want me conforming to traditional gender roles. Easy Bake Oven--that's what I'm going to call my van. Marshall walks in Dude... how was the concert? I couldn't find the outside. End of flashback. Back to the apartment with Lily and Marshall. I can't believe Ted remembered after all these years. Yeah, and after all that weed. Where is he anyway? Staten Island. Why? Staton island. Ted is in the livingroom with kids. Okay, don't tell your mom, but I got you guys some presents. Like the gift of God's love? No, dude, real presents. Uncle Ted got us presents! That's okay, Ted, we'll just give them to charity. Yay! Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight? Uh, you know what, why don't you say it. I really wouldn't know what to say. Why don't you recite your favorite passage of scripture. That's a great idea, Charity. But, really, I don't know. I mean how do you choose your favorite passage? It's the Bible; there's so many... great ones... That one from Pulp Fiction's pretty cool. Doorbell rings.  Ooh, I'll get it. Charity, I'm tapping you in. Dear, Father, thank you for this day, and thank you for bringing this family together. Amen. Ted opens the door and sees everybody. Lily’s holding a beer. Who is it, Ted? Uh, it's... it's just, um, carolers. Marshall starts singing. Robin and Barney follow. # Silent night. Holy night... # I came here to apologize. I'm so sorry, Ted. I accept. Give me the beer. it is so good to see you guys. Are you coming home? Totally. But first, Lily, I owe you an apology. Oh, for the love of God, are you as sick of apologies as I am? Yes Can we just skip the apology and go straight to the forgiving? Yes. And I promise, I will never ever call you a... you know, again. That's okay. I was kind of a Grinch. Kid What's a Grinch? Nothing. It's something you shouldn't say. Mom, what's a Grinch? Stacy spits out the water she had in the mouth. Grinch, Grinch, Grinch... Merry Christmas, everybody. Ted takes his coat and leaves  Run, run. In the apartment Mashall is eating the cookies. Merry Christmas, Marshall. Flashaback. Ted and Robin are at Robin’s apartment. I think I'm in love with you. What?! End of flashback. Well, here's the thing, normal people, you know, people who aren't your dad, usually take longer to say "I love you." Robin went through the usual stages. Flashback. Ted, Robin and Barney are at the apartment. Spider! Spider! I left something in the hallway. Where? Right there. Got it. Ted kisses Robin. Barney comes back to the apartment. First there's the moment when you think you think it. Whoa, still alive. Barney leaves the apartment. There's the moment you think you know it. Oh, you don't want to kiss me, you'll get sick. Ted still kisses her. Two days later he’s the one who’s sick. Totally worth it. There's the moment where you know you know it, but you can't yet say it. All right, it's getting to be that time. I'll talk to you tomorrow? Good night. Good night. Wait, Ted? Yeah? Good night. The next morning, Ted walks into Robin’s apartment. Robin’s on the phone. Well, great, I'll see you then. Bye, sweetie.  Hey. Guess what? My sister Katie is coming to visit next weekend. She gets in on Thursday. That's awesome. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to take off work Friday. We're gonna take her to the Empire State Building. Really? You'd do that? Of course. Everyone should see the Empire State Building. And then there's the moment where you know you know it, and you can't keep it in any longer. Flashback. At Ted’s apartment. Ted. Yeah? Falafel. Credits. Robin and lily are at the airport. Falafel? Falafel. Instead of telling Ted you love him, you said "falafel"? I totally choked. I just don't get it. Why can't you tell Ted you love him? Oh, come on, this is a big deal for me. Oh, God, you'd think you never said it to a guy before. No. Okay, well, I don't usually getthis far in the relationship. I usually take the three-week exit. Don't tell me you're actually buying into Barney's freeway theory. The whole gang is at the bar Watch your steps when you get up, kids, 'cause I am about to drop some knowledge. Relationships are like a freeway. Wait a minute, a month ago you told me relationships are like a traveling circus. No, this is new. This trumps that. Freeways have exits. So do relationships. The first exit, my personal favorite, is six hours in. You meet, you talk, you have sex, you exit when she's in the shower. So every girl you have sex with feels the immediate need to shower? Actually, yeah, I get that. The next exits are four days, three weeks, seven months--that's when you guys are gonna break up, mark your calendars. What? Then a year and a half, 18 years, and the last exit-- death. Which, if you've been with the same woman for your entire life, it's like, "Are we there yet?" End of flashback. Back with Robin and Lily. So I've never been on the freeway this long before. I mean, usually by now I find out the guy has some weird personality thing that makes me want to take the next exit. Yeah, been there. I once dated a guy who could only go to the bathroom when classical music was playing. Okay, it was Marshall. It’s just things are going so well with Ted I just don't want to complicate it. Relax, it'll happen when it happens. Which is also the advice I gave Marshall to get him over the classical music thing. Oh, here comes Katie. Aw, your sister's so cute. Yeah. This reminds me of when I used to see her coming up the driveway from school, with her little pigtails and her Hello Kitty backpack. Her sister is kissing a boy. Hello, Kitty. Oh, no. No. No. No. Hey, Robin. How are you? Oh, good. Good. So, who is this... tongue person? Robin, this is my boyfriend Kyle. Looks like hotness runs in the family. Oh, you said that. Great. So how long have you two been...? Two whole months. Yeah. He's actually coming to visit family in New York, too. Isn't that great? My cousin. He's 23, kind of a wad, but he buys me beer, so... That's cool. This is my friend Lily. Hot. You say things! Well, come on, let's get you back to my place, we'll get you settled. Um, actually, I'm going to stay with Kyle tonight. Uh, no, you're not. Oh, come on. It's kind of a special night. If you know what I mean. What? Oh. Oh... The whole gang is at the bar. I can't believe my baby sister is planning to lose her virginity to a... ...douche with a faux hawk. This can't happen. You guys have to help me talk her out of it. Speech to talk a girl out of having sex. Yeah, I don't have any of those. Discouraging premarital sex is against my religion. Please? I'm her older sister. I'm supposed to teach her how to make good and responsible decisions. 00 and you've already had three scotch and sodas. That's why I need your help. They’re all at the Empire State Building. Robin convinced Katie to stay with her that first night. And the next day, I took everybody to the Empire State Building. You guys are lucky you came here with an architect. Empire State Building fun When construction began on March 17, 1930, the framework rose at a rate of four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. Four and a half stories per week. There it is. There it is. Come on. These are fun facts, guys, let's have fun with them. You know, Katie, I have wanted to come to the Empire State Building for so long, but I waited to come here with someone special. Oh, here we go. Marshall and I have never been to the Empire State Building either. But I'm so glad I waited to do something so important with my fiancee. Speaking of waiting, I signed an abstinence pledge in high school. It's totally cool to wait. And stay away from drugs... other than pot. You told them? Oh, okay, yes, I told them. But only because I think you should hear it from other grownups, too. Everyone thinks you should wait. Right, guys? Totally. You should wait. Sex is fun. See? You are such a hypocrite. You were only 16 when you lost yours. Well, how do you know that? You left your diary in your old room slash my new room. I'll pay you $10,000 for that diary. Look, I've been dating Kyle for two months now. It's like forever. I mean, we've already done everything else. I mean, we've even... Oh. La, la, la, la, la.La, la, la, la, la, la, la,la, la, la, la, la. Even Kyle gets to do that. You have no right to tell me not to do it. But Kyle? Why can't you just wait? Because if you wait, you can get a nice guy like Ted. Robin, this is happening. Look, I already put it up on my Myspace page. I need a clove. You smoke now, too? Oh, remember cloves? No! No "Aw, remember cloves?" This can't happen. She's my baby sister, okay? She should be watching The Little Mermaid and drinking Yoohoo, and not having sex. Come on, you were only 16 when you had sex. I was 17. We were 18. Barney was probably 12. Good one, Ted. I was, uh, six... fourt... How old were you again? 17. Dude, me, too. Barney, you okay? Yeah, of course. What, you don't believe me? - It was at camp, so I'm... What camp? This place in the Catskills. Look it up. I was there teaching for the summer. What did you teach? Uh, dance. Dance? Yeah, Ted, dance. Maybe you've heard of it. It was just a simple summer job, but it turned into so much more. Her name was Frances Houseman, but everyone called her Baby. Flashback. Where Barney work that summer. Sylvia Yes, Mickey? How you call your loverboy? Come here, loverboy And if he doesn't answer Oh, loverboy And if he still doesn't answer? I simply say, baby... Oh, baby. My sweet baby End of flashback. Back to the Empire State Building. That's Dirty Dancing. It was on last night. No, it was two nights ago. "She's Like the Wind" has been stuck in my brain for about 40 hours. I just got it out. Now it's back in. Damn you, Swayze! Do you remember our first time? Yeah. It was back in college. Flashback. 1996. In Marshall and Ted’s college room. Marshall and lily are kissing. Oh, wait, wait. Look... I really want to do this, but... we should make it special, you know? Do this right. Okay. You're right. Maybe we could go to the beach and get a house for the weekend. Yeah, New Year's Eve. Okay. Oh, and we'll light candles and maybe put on some classical music. That's not a good idea. Why not? Long story. But maybe we could put on some Al Green and take a bubble bath together. Oops. End of flashback. Oh, that's adorable. Yeah, tell her what happened next. Back to Marshall and lily’s flashback. That was amazing. Yeah. Want to do it again? Please don't. End of flashback. We said we were sorry. Yeah, well, then why'd you do it again? You know what, I loaned you my Walkman. The point is no matter what, it's never gonna be as perfect as you want it to be. Well, mine was terrible. Wait, I've never heard your story. Well, as you know, I was 16. And it was with my boyfriend Brian. Flashback. Robin’s in bed with Brian. Ready? Yeah. This feels so right. Oh, I know. Oh, Robin. Oh, Brian. Yeah, I'm gay. End of flashback. I'm so sorry. Eh, I should've known. There were signs. Back to Robin’s flashback. Oh, my God! My mom's home. Quick! Get under my bed. What?! Oh, my God! End of flashback. You only get one shot at losing your virginity. And even though I just barely had sex, it counts. What do you mean just barely? Well, he didn't dive all the way into the pool, but he... splashed around in the shallow end. Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count. Yes, it does. No, it doesn't. Yes, it does. No, it doesn't. It doesn't count. End of story. Ooh, why, Lily Aldrin, you saucy little harlot. Could it be that before Marshall took a swim, someone else tested the water? No. Nobody else tested the water, right? Scooter? Who's Scooter? My high school boyfriend, who I did not have sex with. I... I can't believe this. We're Marshall and Lily, when people see us, they say, "Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other." No, Marshall, they say,  "Oh, look at them, they've only had sex with each other." But now that's not true anymore, now you've had sex with twice as many people as I have. I knew that you were too good at it. Know what? I don't want to see the stupid Empire State Building anymore. It's not stupid. I'm going to see Kyle. Katie, please. You only get to lose your virginity once. You should only be having sex with someone who's special. Oh, please, you've had sex with, like, a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys. It's not a hundred guys. I'm sure you were madly in love with all of them. I had different levels of feeling for each of the... very reasonable number of guys. Really. Well, do you love Ted? Do you love Ted ? I, um... The Empire State Building has tons of places where people can have private conversations.  You're off the hook, okay? Just let me explain. You don't have to explain anything. You don't have to say it-- it's fine. Okay, but if relationships are like a freeway, then saying... "hm hm hm" is like... getting into the carpool lane. And I don't want to take an exit, but... at the same time, I'm not ready to get into the carpool lane. Because what's in the carpool lane? Oh, it's a big diamond, and I'm just not ready to get... Okay, Robin, Robin, stop. It's no big deal, you don't have to say it. It's just, it's a big thing to say to someone, and I don't want to say it too soon. What, you mean like I did? No. I didn't... Yeah, like you did. I mean, you have to admit it, Ted, it was a little weird. Weird... or courageous? Pretty sure weird. I mean, who gives it up on the first date? Well, come on, it shows I'm brave and bold, like a knight. No, it shows that you're an I-love-you slut. Well, then you're an I-love-you prude. You know what? I take mine back. You... What? I take my "I love you" back. You can't take it back. Nah. Just did. Got it right here. But, you know, I'm such a slut. I'm just gonna give it away. Hey, you, sir. I love you. Thank you, man. I was going up there to jump. Marshall, why is this such a big deal? "One small step for man, one giant leap for Scooter." Whoa, hey, Adam, guess who got with Eve before you did... Okay, Marshall, I get it. It's a big deal because it rewrites our history. No, it doesn't. Look, have you been to the Empire State Building? No. You've only been in the lobby. People don't buy tickets to get in the lobby. They buy tickets to get to the top. Scooter only got in the lobby, and the lobby doesn't count. Really. Excuse me, sir, uh, can you tell me how to get to the Empire State Building? Man  Um, we're in it right now. Thank you, sir. You're a very wise and brilliant man. You're right. Why would I throw that all away? I'm having the best day! Katie, I'll admit, maybe I'm not in any place to lecture you on romantic relationships, but... but I just don't want you to make the same mistakes that I've made. Oh, believe me, Kyle is not gay. That's not what I meant. I just wish you weren't in such a rush to grow up. Please don't do this. But, kids, later that night, Katie did it, and she got pregnant... with quintuplets... and she lived out her days in a trailer park... where she died an alcoholic. So the moral here, kids, don't have sex until you're married. Maybe even, like, a year or two into marriage. Dad! Come on, what really happened? All right, here's what really happened. Ted is sitting on the coucha t the apartment when Robin comes in. Hey. Hey. She didn't do it. Hey, that's great! You got through to her. No, I didn't. You did. She told me that you talked to her. Flashback. Ted meets Katie et the Empire State Building. Hey, Katie. Hey. Got another Empire State Building fun fact for me? No. I wouldn't bore you with the seven million man-hours it took to build this 102-story testament to human will. So, you okay? I don't know what everyone is freaking out about. Kyle, he's a really nice guy. He could've cheated on me with my lab partner Gretchen Gwynn, but he didn't. 'Cause he said he knew I'd find out. That's very gallant. Well, I don't know what your sister's freaking out about, either. - I was your age my first time. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. It was, uh, it was with this girl, Molly. Flashback. Ted is on the bed with molly. I love you, Ted. Oh, I love you, too, Molly.  But I didn't. That was amazing. Look, I got to go. Where are you going? My cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going out to the woods to light 'em-- it's gonna be awesome. Well, will you call me? Yeah. Yeah, I'll totally call you.  But I didn't. Molly? Yeah? Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back. But I didn't. End of flashback. Back to Katie and Ted. And I never saw her again. I told her I loved her, but... I just wanted to have sex. I-I would've said anything to make that happen, and... that's exactly what I did. Look, I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what all 17-year-old boys are like. Even the nice ones. Flashback. Katie’s at Robin apartment. So I told Kyle I wanted to wait... and he dumped me. Oh, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. Aw, honey. I promise everything is gonna be okay. You want to watch The Little Mermaid and drink some YooHoo? Only if you put a buttload of Kahlua in it. Don't tell Mom. End of flashbacks. Back to robin and Ted. Thanks for doing that. You're welcome. I knew it meant a lot to you. But, man, your story, I mean, it doesn't even sound like you. Yeah, well... Flashback. Ted and molly are on the bed. I love you, Molly. Oh, I love you, too, Ted. Wow. That was amazing. Look, I got to go. Wh-Where are you going? Uh, my cousin got some firecrackers from Mexico. We're going into the woods to light them. It's gonna be awesome. Will you call me? Yeah. I'll totally call you. Oh, Ted? Yeah? Can I borrow 20 bucks? I'll totally pay you back. End of flashback. But she didn't. Oh, come here. I love you. I said it. Feels right. I love you. I'm gay. I'm kidding. I love you, too. Hey... you lost your I-love-you-ginity. Yeah. I guess I was just waiting for the right guy. Katie ended up having a great first time in New York. And the last thing we did before she left was go to the Empire State Building. I am so glad we're finally doing this. What are you talking about? We were here yesterday. Yeah, but that didn't really count. Oh, crap. Exactly! So yesterday doesn't count as having gone to the Empire State Building. So I lost it to you, Marshall. And I rode that elevator to the top, and I saw that view, and I basked in the awesomeness. And that's our story. Yeah. Yeah, that's our story. We've only had sex with each other. We've only had sex with each other. They've only had sex with each other. There are 1,860 steps from this...  Whoa, whoa! Come on! They’re at the bar. So, now you guys can finally say you've been to the Empire State Building. How have you lived here so long and never been to the top? Well, we're usually busy... drinking. Speaking of first times, we never got to hear your virginity story. That's right, I almost forgot. Okay. I was 16, and it was in a baseball dugout... Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I mean, I was in a subway with a high-priced call girl... Risky Business. I was accidentally hacking into NORAD'S computer... That's War Games, and there's not even a sex scene in it. All right! I was 23, and it was with my mom's 45-year-old divorced friend, Rhonda. She called me "Barry" the whole time, and for two weeks, my comforter smelled like menthol cigarettes. You happy? Hey... Why don't you tell us again about your first time at the camp in the Catskills. Baby and her family spent every summer at Kellerman's. Her dad did not approve of our love. Did anyone put Baby in a corner? Oh, God, no. What can I say, I... had... the time of my life. True story. Some kids dream of being astronauts. Some kids dream of playing baseball. When I was a kid, I had only one dream. To build a skyscraper. That's stupid. End of flashback There were some obstacles along the way. But eventually my dream came true. I became an architect. Ted at work. Morning, everyone! So, I had an idea for the atrium. Ready? Columns. That's stupid. Credits. I... I can't believe you knocked over my model. Well, it's just... it's not exactly new, is it-- columns? I mean, what's your next groundbreaking idea-- ceilings? Floors? Windows? Who's this jerk? Well, this jerk was Hammond Druthers, a legend in the architecture community. Very big in the '80s. He was also far and away the worst boss I ever had. Then I designed the Spokane National Bank Building. And suddenly... I was his boss. - And he didn't like it. Stairs? And to be honest, I wasn't sure I liked it either. See, before, when I was just another employee, I was happy, carefree. The guy who hung out in the break room making fun of the boss. Flashback. Ted’s in the break room with two co-workers. Did you see what he was wearing today? It was like his pants were being held up by his nipples. Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it. But suddenly I was a different guy. Ted’s in the break room with two co-workers. Hey, guys. What's so funny? Nothing. Um... nice shirt. Thanks. The hours were insane. I was always working even when I wasn't at work. Ted and Robin are on the bed. Robin is sleeping. Oh, Robin... I just had a great idea. Oh, do whatever you want to me just don't wake me up. Before, I used to be this guy. Dude, of course you should take the day off for the Foo Fighters concert. Just say you're sick. But now...I was this guy. Sick, huh? Unbutton your shirt. Hmm... "Foo Fighters." Get back to work. But still, the worst part was Druthers. End of flashback. Back to work. Well, I was thinking... Ceilings? Oops. Said that already. Then again, you seem to like rehashing old ideas. I'm kidding, of course. Another hole in one, boss. The whole gang’s at the bar. Oh, wow, he must be really good-looking. Why would you say that? Well, 'cause only good-looking people can get away with saying things like that. I have found that to be true. It's a blessing and a curse really. Ted, you can't let him treat you like that. Yeah, you gotta ask yourself, who's the boss? Tony. Angela. Mona. Mona? Watch it more closely. Rock your world. So, what are you gonna do? Well... it's awkward, I mean, the guy used to be my boss. So,  I went to talk to the managing partner. Flashback. Ted is with the Managing Partner. Fire him. Well, sir, I was thinking he could just be put on a different project. Fire him! He's an arrogant, washed-up, pain in the ass. In fact, fire everyone on that project. Druthers, Mosby, the whole lot of them. Mosby, sir? I, I... I hear Mosby's doing some great work. Fine, Mosby can stay. But tell him he's on thin ice. Come here. I like you, Crosby. End of flashback. Back at Ted’s apartment. You mind if I charge my phone? Knock yourself out. Well, Ted, if you do fire Druthers, the key is timing. Remember when I had to fire my makeup artist? Flasback Robin’s work. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims. End of flashback You know what? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna fire Druthers tomorrow. Oh, my God! What? Do you know about this? No. What is that? Only the greatest thing ever. Wait, wait, wait-- that's not enough buildup. If they were to cure cancer tomorrow, this would still be the greatest thing to happen all week. Okay. Now you're ready for naked Marshall. Oh, my God. This is awesome times awesome. It's awesome squared. I know, right? Behind the piano this whole time. Wait. If Marshall went to all this trouble to hide it, he clearly doesn't want us to find it. Oh, come on, Robin. No, I'm saying that he must be really embarrassed by this. We are gonna have so much fun. I know! We're gonna have so much fun! At Ted’s work. Oh, sorry I'm late; lunch ran a little long. You wanted to see me, Mosby? Uh, yeah, like four hours ago. Well, excuse me, for spending the last four hours drawing designs for your building. This is a cocktail napkin. Covered in profanity. Look, Hammond, um, there's no easy way to say this, so... why don't we just, um, step into your office. The others employees come with a cake and singing. Happy birthday to you. Oh, you had me. You so had me. In Ted’s apartment. So, you didn't fire him? I can't fire a guy on his birthday. Everyone would hate me. Besides, they put a party hat on me. My authority was compromised. Oh, hey, Marshall. Have a seat. I know how much you love stools. Thanks. Yeah, stools are better for your posture. And, uh... I... got you a rose. Thank you. That's so sweet. You guys are being... so sweet. Hey, guys. Guess what I got. A new dart. Oh,  wow, a new dart. Hey, that new dart is great. I did not know you were such a fan of new dart, Barney. Oh, yes, Robin, I just love new dart. Nude art. Nude art. Nude art. Okay, all right, so what, you guys found the painting, huh? I knew this day would come. How did you know that? Because I didn't hide it very well. Flashback. In 1998, lily’s on the bad while marshall’s playing a videogame. So  the story on the painting is that,back in college, Lily wanted to do a nude study for her art class. Marshall wasn't so into the idea. Well, I just... don't think that some dude should drop trou just to pose for you. It's for class, and it's just that weird kid Hunter from my freshman hall. The frisbee dude with the soul patch? He's like the hottest guy in school! No, he's actually a little husky... Oh, he's just huggable! And complicated... and a little bit of a jerk. Just enough so you think maybe you can change him. Okay, just forget it. Call me old-fashioned, I just think that I'm the only guy you should see naked. Well, then you'll have to do it. Are you kidding me? What if somebody sees it? We're not in high school anymore. People don't make fun of you for posing nude for a painting. We're adults now. End of flashback. We totally saw your butt. This painting has caused too much grief already. I'm destroying it right now. Oh, no, what's the matter, Marshall? Where is it? I'll tell you where it is if you'll answer these riddles three. You hung it up in the bar, didn't you? Yo, why you gotta ruin my riddles? Field trip! Marshall comes running into the bar with the others Oh, no. Someone put your painting up behind the bar. Classic! What a memorable prank. Hey, Marshall. What'll you have? What'll I have? Um, I don't know, maybe a beer and that nude painting of me hanging behind the bar! Ooh, I'm sorry, that painting's property of the bar. I know that Barney gave you that painting. I don't know what you're talking about. Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay you double. I doubt it. Whatever he's paying you, I'll give you that plus ten bucks. I doubt it. All right, you know what, Carl, you just lost yourself a regular customer. I doubt it. This painting is the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Okay, where should we put it up next? In his law school? Ooh on the side of a bus. Oh, oh! How much do billboards cost? Easy, Scherbatsky. Finesse. I've got a five-year rollout plan. I'll have you know that painting's got commitments all over the city. Then, after New York... Marshall runs to the painting, takes it and goes out yelling. One of my worst fears has come true-- I just saw Marshall grabbing himself naked. Well, I gotta go. Believe it or not, I have to go back to the office. Oh, I'll go out with you. Bye, guys. Ted and Robin leave. There’s only Lily ant Barney left. You know, I wish everyone didn't have to make fun of that painting. Eh, we're not making fun of the painting, we're just making fun of Marshall. The painting's actually really great. Are you serious? Yeah. Well, thank you. You know, seeing it again makes me miss painting nudes. What? Paint me. What? Paint me. Ted is at the office. Who's that? Who's out there? Hammond, is that you? Mosby? Druthers and I were alone in the office. If I was gonna fire him, this would be the best chance I'd ever have. Uh, look, just a second, Ted. Uh, no, I, I really need to talk to you. Look, there's no easy way to say... What, what are you doing? What are you doing? I’m standing here wearing pants. Are you sleeping here? What's going on? Okay, fine, yes. Not that it's any of your business but my wife had a little spat a few weeks ago, and I've been sleeping here until she cools off. Okay, well, uh, you're right-- that is none of my business. Uh, look, there's no easy way to say this-- I... Who am I kidding? She's never gonna take me back. It's okay. What did you want to say to me? Happy birthday, buddy. So, you've been living at the office? Yes. I'm an architect without a home. You see the tragic irony in that? Yeah, I do. Cause I design homes. I see it. But I don't have a home. Not lost on me at all. But I don't understand, why don't you just go to a hotel? You could be sleeping on a mattress instead of... what appears to be torn-up drawings of my building. Why  would I go to a hotel, when any second, she's going to call and tell me to come home. She's a very special lady, Ted. She's quite... mannish. She gives me what I need. Do you understand that? Uh,  no, I don't. If you were lost in the wilderness, she can provide for me. Well, that's the dream. I'm glad you came here tonight, Ted. Me too, Hammond. Call me Ham. No, thanks. Hammy D? No, I think just Hammond. Robin and Ted are at the apartment. Mr Druthers is on the couch. So, I'm guessing you didn't fire him. I was this close. Meanwhile, Lily had been up all night in the grips of a dilemma. Lily’s trying to wake up marshall. Oh honey, you're awake? I'm awake. Is everything okay? Yeah. I've kind of been wrestling with something. What if I told you I had a way to pay for our honeymoon? Baby, our honeymoon's already paid for. We're going to Howe Caverns. Well yeah, but-- but what if we didn't want to spend our honeymoon in a cave? It's not just a cave, it's a whole labyrinth of caves. It's an underground adventure. There's a cave that's so dark that you don't even know you're in there. I mean, we're going to experience a whole new kind of dark. Well, what if I found a way to make a little extra money so that we spend our honeymoon not in Howe Caverns, but in Scotland? Loch Ness? Yeah. And you know, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Glasgow... Loch Ness. Nessy. Baby, I would love to search for the enchanted creature of the Emerald Loch, but... we can't afford that. Maybe we can. Flashback. Barney and lily are at Mclaren’s. Paint me. Okay, I don't get this. You've been making fun of that painting all this time and now you want me to paint you? We knew we could torture Marshall because he has shame. I do not. In my body, where the shame gland should be, there's a second awesome gland. True story. Yeah, that's not the gland I'm worried about painting. Yeah. A nude Barney is a challenge. But I think you're talented enough to immortalize this. Now is the time-- I'm 31. I'm at the peak of my physical beauty. If I were a woman, I'd have passed it long, long ago. Long ago. Forget it. I promised Marshall he was the only guy I would ever see naked. I'll give you $5,000. End of flashback. Back to Lily and Marshall. We're going to Loch Ness! Yeah! Ted arrives at the office. That cabby would not shut up. Yeah, we should call him a gabby. I think it, you say it. Hey, uh... thanks for putting me up last night, buddy. Give 'em hell. Morning, team. So, I have given it some thought, and I say we revisit columns. Oh! It's from ancient Greece. They want their basic architectural elements back. Geez. What? You didn't hear me? Toga, parchment... Can I see you for one second? Ooh, I'm in trouble now. What are you doing? I thought we were friends. You slept on my couch, you ate my cereal. I tossed you more toilet paper. We are friends. But that doesn't magically make your bad ideas good. What? I don't believe this! You're, you're, you're wearing my clothes! And my girlfriend's... sneakers, man, you have weirdly small feet. Ted, I hope that you're not going to let our professional woes interfere with our friendship, because  I really kind of need you right now. Lily is with Barney in the room. Okay, let's get this over with. Hey, hey! I don't want you phoning this in. This painting could, someday, become a serious work of art. I mean, you have been blessed with an amazing gift. Thank you. I meant me. Now, I like how you captured Marshall's essence. Goofy and unburdened, with wit. But me, I want something more regal. Something my progeny could look at and say, "There's stands Barnabus Stinson." He was wise... and strong. I don't think your sword will fit. I get that a lot. And so, as Lily began painting, Marshall thought about the $5,000 and what his fiancee was doing to earn it. Marshall is at the bar with money on his hands. This isn't right. This isn't right at all. Finally, he could take it no more. Back to the room where lily’s painting. Hold still. Hold still. Hold still! Paint faster! Okay, I guess it's time. Drop your shorts. Yeah. Wait, wait! That wasn't enough buildup. I need... In a world without justice, one man… Oh, just drop them! All right. Marshall comes in. No! No, this is not right! We had a deal! Well, I'm going back on the deal. Barney, get out! You...! It's over! . It's beautiful and they say it's haunted. I'm never letting my fiancee, ever...!  Oh, you're still here? Before you say anything, I'll give you an extra five grand. We accept. You people are so easy to control. Dance for me, puppets, dance. And that's how Uncle Barney paid for Lily and Marshall's honeymoon. Ted is at the office. Come on, Ted, listen, why don't we get back and finish drawing the plans for a building which, in my opinion, is never going to get built, so you and I can get out of here and grab a couple of beers. No. Look, Hammond, there's no easy way to say this but... Looking for Hammond Druthers. Oh, that's me. I'm Hammond Druthers. These are divorce papers. You've been served. Oh, God. She's really going through with this. So that's it. It's over. There is no easy way to say this, but... She's giving me the remains of Wolfie? My dog is dead? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. She always played too rough with him. Believe me, there is no easy way to say this… # Happy birthday to you... # You've got to be kidding me! Guys, you have no idea how much this means to me right now. Wait, his birthday was yesterday! Yeah, but a bunch of us were up at the conference in Montreal, so we thought... No! No birthday! No! I got something to say and I'm gonna get it out. Hammond, listen to me. I am sorry that your dog died, and that your wife is divorcing you and that... your life is falling apart and that these guys missed your birthday. And there is no easy way to say... What are you doing? What's going on? Oh, God... Oh, come on, you're not going to pull that, are you? Oh! Look, yeah, right. Now we're falling onto the ground. Well, nice try, but guess what? You're fired! You're fired,  you get it? You hear me? You're gone! You're fired!  In my defense, I think we all suspected Hammond might have been faking. On the plus side, the EMTs seem to think he's going to be just fine and, as you saw, they did admit that I did not cause the heart attack, even if they said it a bit begrudgingly. They all hated me. But just when all seemed lost, I had the greatest idea of my entire career. Margarita Fridays--great idea, boss. Lily is still painting Okay, it's done. I'm gonna step out, so you can admire it. Thank you very much, Lily. Lily steps out of the room. Marshall, do you have the money? Yeah. Let's get out of here! A smooth area?! You gave me the Ken doll?! Marshall and Lily get out of the apartment. She left out Little Barney. Barnacle Junior. My Barnana is... Barnito Supreme. They’re all at Mclaren’s Marshall, you're on beer detail. Lily, you're making the bean dip. Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels, and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem. "Problem." Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something about his flying problem. It's not a problem if you're awesome at it. And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food, the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter. If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys. Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care. I'm crazy like that. Here's the info for tomorrow night. What's tomorrow night? Oh, God, you didn't hear? Mark died. Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh. 00, and I know it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came. You guys were his favorite customers. Stay strong. We're so sorry. Who was Mark? No idea. Not a clue. Well, I guess we should go, right? 00, that's the Super Bowl. Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike. Mark. Get out of here! I never want to see your face in this bar again! This soulless bastard just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral because he wants to watch the Super Bowl. Could you believe that? You guys are coming, right? Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world. CREDITS At the apartment they’re preparing for the funeral. record the game, go to the funeral, pay our respects to Matt... Mark. Mark, and start watching only an hour late. Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records, maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer to the TiVo gods. the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak is nothing short of Godlike. Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials. It seems greedy to ask anything more from you, O magic box, but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl, we will destroy you in the alley with baseball bats. Amen. Amen. We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials. Yeah, they're the best part. Oh, come on. Remember last year? Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza? Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute. Barney comes into the apartment. He’s on the phone. Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today. Okay. Good-bye. You didn't hang up either! I know! You hang up! You hang up! My bookie. Great guy. So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up? Have I taught you nothing, Ted? Virtually. Suits are full of joy. They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile. «Sartorial"? "Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade." Suits are for the living. That's why when it's my time to R.I.P. I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it buck naked. Yeah. It's gonna be awesome. Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies. What up?! At the funeral, they all see Mark and remember who he was. Such a waste. I know. He was so young. A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce &amp; Gabbana. It must be so frightened. 00. They’re at the bar for the wake. And even though we didn't see any whales, Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives. Okay, I'm getting us another round. And when I come back, everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story. Dibs on the one Carl just told. Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now. Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it. We should just find out the score. Oh, thank God! I'll find out. No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together. It's tradition. Think of all the great times we've had watching this game. Flashback. In 2003, they’re all watching the Super Bowl. Second down, everyone drink. Ted, it's not a drinking game if you drink anytime anything happens. Are these chicken wings or angel wings? God, I love these things. I love you guys. This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together. This is special. We need to do this every year, promise me! Calm down, buddy. Oh, commercials! Everyone drink! In 2004. God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together. How did this start? Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal. I don't bet. Betting's for suckers. Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal. Fine. See, there you go, he made it. You win. Wait. This is mine, just like that? God, that feels good. No, that feels really... good. What else can we bet on? Nothing, it's the halftime show. Oh, so lame. Nobody even pays attention. I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares? In 2006. God, how cool is Robin? I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months to  our sacred day. Now she's gonna be in all the pictures. Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks plus six points for 500 bucks. Are you crazy? Maybe for $50. $50?! What fun is $50?! Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall! Okay, $50. Hey, I'll take that action. Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand. Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings? Oh, commercials! Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious. End of flashback. Back to the bar. 00 and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won. That's impossible. I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy. That means no TV, no Internet, no newspapers, nothing. Media blackout. But our tradition lives on. Who's in? I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. What the hell, I'm in. High five! Dude, we're at a wake. Sorry. Solemn low five. Ted opens the door of his apartment to take the newspaper. As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl. I decided to work from home to avoid contamination by the outside world. Barney comes in Hey,  take this key and swallow it. What? No. Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time. Lots more, no. I'm not messing around, Theodore. I've got a lot of money riding on this game. If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator, I'll check the score. Please take the key. Fine. But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan and I think that's funny. Robin at work. The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin because, well, she was the media. But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing the unusually large pothole any time soon, so buckle up if you're on the BQE. It's gonna be a bumpy one. Like morning commutes needed to get any harder. You're right, Kevin. Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid for a sports update. No! What? No. But it's, uh, time for Sports. No, it's not. It's time for Weather. We, we just did Weather. Well, weather's pretty fickle, it may have changed. What's it doing out there, Lou? Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago. Back to you, Robin. Okay, now it's time for Sports. No! Let's go to Traffic Todd in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper. Robin, it's time for Sports! Over to you, Sid. Thank you, Kevin and Robin. Let's talk about the Super Bowl. Marshall is in Lily’s classroom. Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day. And he's a little bit double-jointed... And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster. Lily, how many times...? Nessie is a gentle creature. We're trying to stay away from terms like "Monster." Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting than Sally's one-eyed goldfish. Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally. Okay, well, that's all the time we have. Arts and crafts, everybody. Hey. I'm Doug. Oh, hey, I'm Marshall. Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day? Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out 'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl. I know who won. Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know, so if you could just keep that to yourself. How badly do you not want to know? Excuse me? Ten  bucks. Are  you serious? Just went up to eight. Ted’s place. Barney’s still tied up to the radiator. Unlock me, Ted. I've never gone this long without calling my bookie. He worries. Not until game time. Where are you going? Pick up the hot wings. What? How the hell are you planning on getting in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score? There's TVs everywhere. high-tech noise-reducing headphones I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together and were doing it a lot. I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000. Ted walks into a sports bar. Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby. I'm here to pick up my hot wings. In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings plus a generous tip. Please take the cash. Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way. Thank you! Back to Metro News One. And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl. Back to you, Kevin and Robin. Robin has blocked her ears. We'll be right back. And we're clear. I'm sorry. Um, Robin, is it just me, or were you doing something different there? I haven't watched the game yet. I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl. I mean, change the teleprompter. No team names, nothing specific. That is crazy. I can't do that. My friend Mark passed away this week. Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry. Back in five... four... three... It’s just so hard. At the apartment, Barney’s trying to free himself from the radiator. He finally does it and runs to the bathroom. 8 minutes and 23 seconds later Ted comes back with the chicken wings. Ha! Who's the idiot now?! You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid. But it totally worked!  No...! And if that weren't bad enough, I was about to have a horrible realization. Where's the dipping sauce? Marshall is still in lily’s classroom. Lily’s reading a book. The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with? Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop if I ate all those crayons. Why are you doing this? I'm in love with Miss Aldrin. Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine. Doug drops an object and breaks it. Okay, now who did this? I did. Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out? Well, Marshall's a grownup, so... When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out. Sorry. Marshall gets a time-out. At Robin’s work. And after the Super Bowl, the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up, sending the mayor of the winning team's city 15 pounds of a delicacy his of her city is famous for. Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor. Back to lily’s classroom. Hey. Hey. I’m not talking to you. Yes, you are. You'll do whatever I say. Hold your breath. I'm not holding my breath. you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week... And then Uncle Marshall got an idea. It was not one he was proud of in retrospect, but desperate times... Marshall takes a glass of water and throwns it on Doug’s pants. Oh, no. Somebody wet their pants. No, I didn't. You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off or am I gonna have something for show and tell today? Hey, everyone... Okay, okay. You win. I want my money back. And your pudding snack pack. Barney’s running on the street. Sir, who won the Super Bowl? Sorry. I missed the game. You missed...?! How could he miss...? Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?! I... don't really follow sports. Oh, my...! Emmitt Smith! Oh, thank God. Yeah, I get that a lot. You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl? The game was last night? You know, once you win two or three of those things, it's kind of like, eh. But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday. What could possibly be more important than football?! Dance, my friend. Dance. No...! Barney’s on the knees. Ted walks passed him but doesn’t see him with his glasses. Hello! It's me again. Oh! I didn't recognize you. Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce! Ah. Yes. This is the one. 00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible. But then, almost simultaneously, things started to go wrong. Robin’s finishing the news. And let's end the day on a happy note. There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo. Trish Sanchez has the story. Lily’s closing the classroom and Marshall’s drinking at a fountain when the cleaner walks there with his radio. Barney is still in the street looking for the results and he finds kiosk. Ted’s leaving the sports bar. Hey, buddy. Hey, dude, look out. At the Bronx Zoo. And in honor of yesterday's big win... At the sports bar. Hey, buddy, look out. Dude, watch out! At the Zoo. ...the zoo decided to name the baby panda after Super Bowl champions... No...! No...! No...! Ted falls without dropping the sauce. Yes...! Monday, 18h15, Robin, Marshall and Lily comes into the apartment. Awesome. Just in time for kick-off. None of you guys found out the score, right? Mission accomplished. Didn't find out. Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready.  Barney, I can't even look at you. I don't want any sign of who won. Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away. Feel free to start without me. Ah...!  Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! So much money! You screwed it up, Barney! You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Okay, let's watch the game. Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on. Now you've ruined the game for everyone. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney. Way to blow it. Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know. There's no point in even watching the game. Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined. Wings are still good. Beer still works. Ah, what the hell. Let's watch Barney lose some money. I got extorted by a five-year-old today. I almost got fired today. I met Emmitt Smith today. Ooh, you go first. I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000. Yeah, go ahead, Barney. Well, I was frantically running down the street trying to find out the score to the game... And here's the funny part, as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was, here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won... Hell, I don't even remember who played. What I do remember is that we drank beer, we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together. Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride. We even raised a toast to good old Mike. I mean Mark. Matt. Crap! Why do I keep doing that? Ted and Barney are at Mclaren’s. I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet. Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges, coin toss... What are the odds of losing the coin toss? 50-50, give or take. Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks, whether or not there'd be a safety, first... Ted puts on his sensory deprivator 5000 and Barney keeps talking.. 2007. Robin and Ted are running in a airport. That security guard was a little bit handsy. That's funny. She barely touched me. Uh, Gate 23. Come on. If we miss this flight, I will never forgive myself. Why was this flight so important? Let's back up a few months to the fall of 2006. I had just sold my first building design and become the youngest project manager in my firm's history. Suddenly I was being headhunted. One firm was even considering me to run their entire New York office. They were flying me in for a final interview at their corporate headquarters in Chicago. It was the opportunity of a lifetime. It was my destiny. There was just one problem. Robin and Ted arrive at the gate. Hi, wait, two more. Sorry, you're too late, I already shut the doors. Well, I'm sure if we pull real hard we can open them. Hmm, I wish it worked like that, but see, once I close those doors, that's it. Nobody else is allowed down that jet-way. Except for that guy. Please, if-if I miss this flight, I'll miss the chance to interview for my dream job. I'm sorry, sir. His dream job! Didn't you ever have a dream job? Something from when you were a little girl, that was all you wanted to do? I mean, for God's sakes, I'm sure you didn't go to bed at night dreaming about being a... I mean, uh... This is a cool job. Please, I have to be on this flight. I'll see what I can do. But it doesn't look good. Thanks. Your uniforms are pretty. CREDITS Okay. They haven't armed the doors yet, so you still have a chance. It's up to the captain now and they're calling us back. Great, please let us know as soon as you hear anything. Sure, and for the future, we recommend you arrive at the airport an hour and a half before your flight, not, you know, one minute after. Normally, I'm incredibly responsible. I just had to go to court this morning and get sentenced. Not that I'm a criminal or anything. Yeah, he just jumped a subway turnstile. You seem to have a lot of problems with the rules of travel.  Hello? Oh, that is great news. It's my mom-- she found her missing earring. Have a seat. I'll call you when I hear something. Where was it? That thing better have call waiting. Could you just call the firm and explain what happened? It's down to three people and I know they need to make their decision today. I sort of feel my not showing up might put me at a disadvantage. I'm so stupid. Why did I have to jump that turnstile? Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. And isn't this whole thing really Barney's fault? She had a point. It was kind of Barney's fault. Let's back up a few months. Flashback. A few months earlier Marshall, Lily, Robin and Ted are at Mclaren’s. Oh, Marshall, how's the broken toe? Oh, man, it kills. You  want some aspirin, baby? You know I don't believe in pain killers. Wow, your first broken bone. Kind of kills your whole "Unbreakable" theory. Marshall used to think he was indestructible. Well, it added up. I've never broken anything. I've never been sick, and when I need to, I can summon incredible strength. Ted, tell her the story of the really heavy door. There was a really heavy door. He opened it. On one pull. Well, you must be really bummed, you're not gonna be able to run tomorrow. Yeah. It sucks, all that work I put in training for the marathon was a total waste. Training for a marathon. What? You don't need to train for a marathon. You just run it. You're kidding, right? Not at all. I could run a marathon anytime I wanted to. So like tomorrow, you think you could wake up, roll out of bed, and just run the New York City Marathon? Absolutely. Barney, we're talking about 42 kilometers. Thanks, Canada. I'll take it from here. Barney, it's like 26 miles. Here's how you run a marathon. Step one, you start running. There is no step two. Okay, you know what? Prove it. Take my number and run in my place. I will bet you 50 bucks you don't even finish the race. 50 bucks? Gee, Grandpa, if I win, maybe I can buy myself an ice-cream cone. Make it $10,000. You have a gambling problem. You'll bet me 50. Fine, then no bet. Okay, $50. The next morning, as the marathon began, we were focused on Marshall's computer. Each runner gets a tracking chip so you can follow them online, see when they pass certain checkpoints. Barney's got mine in his shoe. Ooh, he's starting! This ought to be good. Wow.  He's already passing the second checkpoint. This tracking thing is amazing. When we get married, you're getting one of these. 53 minutes later… Wow. Look at his time. It's pretty impressive. He's gotta be cheating, okay. He knew we'd check. Yeah, he'll do anything to win a bet. Remember that time he bet me that Men at Work sang "Hungry Like the Wolf," and when he found out that they didn't, he tried to hire them to? Well, it looks like, "Barney" should be coming over the Queensboro Bridge and up First Avenue within the next hour or so. But... there is no way that that's really him. Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin are on the course to see if Barney’s running. It's really him. A runner takes lily’s water. Hey! That's mine. Yeah, you'd better run! Back to the apartment… What up, non-finishers? Wow. Very impressive, Barney. Right? Yeah, my time would have been like a half an hour better, but I met this total hottie on Mile Seven. We took a quick detour and had our own mini marathon behind a Nathan's. I  won. I'm not sure anyone in that story is a winner. So where's my 50 bucks? All right. I got to admit, you earned this. Huh? Can't believe they haven't made a coin for this yet. Anyway, I'm heading home. Might go hit the gym. Oh, hey, just so you know, uh, all marathon runners get to use the subway for free today. Wow.  You know I really should check out this "subway." Heard so much about it. Wow. Look at me. Slumming it. Maybe I'll make a weekend out of it and I'll call my bridge and tunnel girl tonight. You're dating a girl from New Jersey? No. Barney leaves the apartment… So Barney did it. He actually finished the marathon. But a little while later... I got an interesting phone call. Hello? Ted, it's Barney. Listen to me, I need you to come and pick me up on the subway. What, what are you talking about? I was sitting here, totally minding my own business. Flashback. 2 hours earlier, Barney is sitting on the subway next to two girls. Finisher. Yeah, you know what I mean. 86th street. Barney stands up but fell. The Subway continues. End of flashback. My legs don't work. I've already ridden the subway twice end to end. I've seen where it turns around. Ted, you don't ever want to see where the subway turns around. Barney's legs won't work. He's riding the subway from end to end because he physically can't get off the train. Best 50 bucks I ever spent. Listen to me, Ted. I'm going to lose you any second. I'm on the fourth car of the six train heading south from Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Meet me at the 86th Street station in, like, half an hour? All right. I'll be right there. Stay where you are. Ted, Ted. A pregnant woman, on ald lady and a boy in crutches wait for Barney to give up his place. Oh, come on. You're not even going to give up your seat for him? I'm sorry. I can't. Douche. 25 minutes later, Ted arrives at the station. Barney?! Ted! Ted jumpes a subway turnstile A policeman catches him. Hey! No...! End of flashbacks. Back to the airport with Robin and Ted. See? If Barney never tried to run the marathon, you never would have jumped that turnstile, you wouldn't have had that court date today, and we would have made this flight. You're right. Everything can be traced back to him. Like that rash we all got at Christmas. I have to see what's going on. So I was able to get you two seats. Really? That's great! No, no, not you. I'm talking to my mom about Blue Man Group. Ma, can I call you back? Okay, what about our flight? Can we get on? I'm still waiting for... Huh. Looks like your flight left already. What? No, n-n-n-no, n-no. I have to be in Chicago today. Well, he never even called you back? Well, it's typical pilot.They don't call you back at work and they don't call you back after you spend two nights with them at a Radisson in Orlando. It turned out there was one other flight that would just barely get me to Chicago on time for my job interview, but it was all the way on the other side of the airport. What was the name of the airline again? I think it was something like Flights R' Us. Was the "R" backwards? God, I hope not. Geez. Stupid smart carts. More like dumb carts. If we miss this flight, it's all Barney's fault. You know, Barney never would have run the marathon in the first place if Marshall hadn't broken his toe. Yeah, so? What, you think this is my fault? For Marshall, the initial idea to run the marathon came way back in April. April 2006. Marshall and Lily are in the bathroom. My pants are starting to feel a little tight. Oh, that's okay. I love that cute little belly. I cannot allow this. What? I am going to run the New York City Marathon. Marshall starts training for the marathon. "It is important to load up on carbohydrates two to four hours before a big run. Try a breakfast of a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, strawberries and some orange juice." Here you go, Marshmallow. Just like the book said. Yeah, but from now on, I'm eating all of my breakfast runner-style. Liquids are digested faster. That way, no energy is wasted, and it's all about the run. "Don't forget to give yourself plenty of positive reinforcement." This is gonna be your best run yet. You're going to accomplish all of your goals. You are a robot sent from the future to win the marathon! You are... Marshall. You are... Marshall. You are Marshall! Yeah! "Chafing or blisters can occur in a number of areas, including the feet, armpits, or even the nipples. Try using some petroleum jelly on the affected areas." Marshall comes into the apartment scratching himself and goes to the bathroom. Oh, gosh! Dude, you are a terrific runner. Tomorrow you're gonna run and finish the New York City Marathon! You're the best. You look good. Nobody does it better than you. Robin comes in the bathroom behind Marshall. Marshall? Oh, my God! End of flashback. Back to the airport… So, yes, it was your fault. I  mean, if you don't show up at the apartment in the middle of the day, Marshall doesn't break his toe, Barney doesn't run in his place, I don't jump the turnstile and get a court date, and we make our flight in plenty of time!  And I don't fall down and bite my tongue at the airport. That really wasn't my fault. I  wouldn't have walked in on Marshall if it weren't for Lily. Hey, think about it. Flasback. Ted and Robin eat while walking on the street. Hey, what's going on here? Oh, looks like they're camping out for something. Yeah, but for what? 00 a.m." Oh, my God. Can you believe what some nut bags will do to save a few bucks? Barney, Ted, Lily and Robin are at Mclaren’s. We have to camp out. Are you serious? You don't understand. This is an amazing sale. I've heard about it before, but I never knew where it was. We'll have a wedding dress campout. It'll be fun. I can't go. I've got this thing. What thing? A penis. Lily and Robin arrive at the wedding dress shop. This is the place. Oh, wow. Badgley Mischka! Melissa Sweet! Vera Wang! Oh, Robin, do you have any idea what you guys stumbled onto here? You said wang. Oh, this reminds me of the ticket line to Lilith Fair, 1998. Only fewer mullets. You should feel good. You're only, like, the tenth craziest bride in New York. Ooh, this is comfy. We might actually be able to sleep. On alarm starts beeping. That's kind of annoying. Well, I'm sure somebody will be out here to turn it off any minute.  I don't think I can take this. Every time it turns off, I think, oh, maybe it won't turn on again, but then it does. Why does it, Robin? Why does it keep turning on? It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why... Why don't we make a game out of it, okay? Why don't we sing along? 3 hours later, the alarm didnt’ turned off. If we get through this, I swear I'm gonna live my life differently. I just want to tell my parents I love them one more time. A man comes and shut down the alarm. Morning, ladies. It's him. It's the car guy! Get out of here! All women throw things at him. The next morning, Robin was too tired to go all the way back to Brooklyn, so while I was at work, she went to crash at my apartment for a couple hours, and that's when... Nobody does it better than you. Marshall?! Oh, my God! End of  flashback. At the airport. So if Lily hadn't dragged me down to the wedding dress store, we would have made the first flight. Oh, thank God. The doors are still open. We made it. Hi. Please. We really need to get on this flight. Oh, my God! You're that reporter from Metro News 1. Yes, yes, I am. I can't believe you recognized me. You did that story on the giant pizzas? Would you check to see if you have any more seats? One moment, sir. Were those pizzas real? Come on, were they? Robin... One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is, the pizzas were real. - Calzones. Trick photography. I knew it! God, it is so nice to meet a fan! And I would be a fan of your work if you could get us two seats on that next flight. Well, the, uh, flight attendants are just finishing up their final seat count. Let me see what I can find out. Would it help if I got on and gave an impassioned speech about my destiny? I think it might hurt. This is such a nightmare. Okay, so we agree? This goes back to Lily wanting to camp out for a wedding dress? No. Wait. It goes back further. Remember why we were eating hot dogs on the East Side? Flashback. Ted is in the subway. 1939?! This penny's from 1939!  A 67-year-old penny. Do you realize this penny was minted during World War II? Oh, so was my grandfather, but that doesn't make him interesting. Look, I know a little something about coins, and  this baby is worth something to a collector. No, it's not. Yes, it is ! You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner with the money I get for this little guy. And that's exactly what I did. They’re on the street. You're lucky there's still a place that serves anything for a dollar fifty. Hey, that's 150 times its original value. Actually, the meal was only $1.49. 1984. Hey, in 50 years, we can get dinner again. How dare you. Hey, what's going on? I don't know. Looks like they're camping out for something. Yeah, but for what? End of flashback. Back to the airport. It was me. I started this. If I hadn't picked up that penny, we wouldn't have gone to get hot dogs all the way across town. And we wouldn't have seen that wedding dress store, Lily wouldn't have wanted to camp out there,  and I wouldn't have needed a nap at your apartment the next day. Marshall wouldn't have broken his toe. Barney wouldn't have run the marathon. I wouldn't have jumped that turnstile, gotten arrested, had that court date... And we would have made our flight. I don't think we can go back any further than that unless you know who dropped the penny. I wish I did. Though that person's already been punished enough, losing a sweet penny like that. Uh, sir? Oh, please tell me you have some good news. Uh, I'm afraid not. There are no extra seats on the plane. I'm sorry. All, right, well, thanks for trying. I can't believe this. That's it, it's over. Ted, come on. Your destiny just wasn't to make it to Chicago today. Anyway, if that firm really wants you, they'll reschedule. But that's not what happened. They didn't reschedule. They hired someone else. And as it turned out, three months later, that guy ended up having to relocate to Chicago. Kids, funny thing about destiny, I thought I was destined to get that job. But I was wrong. My destiny was to stay in New York. Because if I hadn't, I never would have met your mother. Barney is still in the subway and three guys steal his medal. Ted and Robin are et the bar. How about Mimi's? Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's. Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go. Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's. You love that place, remember what a great time we had the last time we were there? We did? Yeah, yeah. We had that crazy waiter who kept going, "You two should get married! You two should get married!" It's also important to know when to stop talking. Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining. It was so romantic? How can you not remember this? Because it wasn't me. Oh, right! It was... my sister. You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s, you've dated a few people, but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend that you haven't. Ted and Robin are at the apartment. Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on. Remember when we went to see it? We sat in the back row. I've never seen Van Helsing. That's right. I saw it with my sister. My boss just got back from Maui. He said it was really romantic. Oh, it's so romantic. When were you in Maui? I... went... with my sister. With my sister. Why do you always say that? Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people. It's silly to try to act like we didn't. You're right. We should just be honest. Totally. They’re back at the bar. See that girl over there? Three years ago, I totally made out with her. I don't want to hear that. What? You said... God, that is so insensitive. Remember honesty...? You're a jerk! Well, you're...confusing. CREDITS Marshall is at the bar with Barney. Okay, so you have to have sex with one. Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human, or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human. Go! I don't know. Is she fat? Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat. Hot off the presses! I-I don't take flyers. You took one two seconds before you walked in here. That's different. It was for a strip club. Two bucks off wings. How much is your flyer going to save me on wings? Fine. It's a flyer from my play. Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college and I'm not trying to sleep with you. So anyway, this mermaid... Hey, Lily's friend asked her to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good. Friends  don't let friends come see their crappy play. Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish. Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us. Yes, you should break up. So, earlier tonight... Flashback. Ted and Robin are on the couch. Mm, we should get down to the bar. I know we should, but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt. End flashback. Oh, God, why is this part of the story? We're getting to it. Flashback. Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here? Yeah, there's some in the bathroom. Got to moisturize! Got to keep that pretty face moist. End flashback. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! What's wrong with her? She hates that word. What word, "moist"? No! Seriously, stop! So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist... face lotion... Flashback. Wow, this is great stuff. Now I know the secret to your great complexion. What are you talking about? It's yours. No, it's not. Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's. End flashback. No, it's not. Flashback. Whose moisturizer is this, Ted? Um, my sister's. So, in other words, some girl you went out with. Um... I love you. Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes? End flashback. It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck. I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face. Thank you, Marshall. Thank you so much. Flashback. Why is that still in your apartment? I don't know. I just never threw it out. Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl? Yeah. I'm madly in love with her, and the only way I can deal with it is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion. Not three dollars! Try 14. Why is this such a big deal? Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer! Whoa, she wasn't a whore. Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town. It sounds like a whore to me. What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around? Nothing. That's it. Well, except for the phone booth. And the lamp by the desk... and the... No. No! No! Oh, Ted! End flashback. after  you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff? Question? Ain't no question, girl. Obviously, he's got to get rid of it. Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it. So we agreed that we would let you guys decide. Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants. Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants. Flashback. Marshall comes in with pants. Nice, right? I'm gonna have to say no. I don't want some 16-year-old girl falling in love with you and then shooting Lily in the face. Yes! I vote they can stay. "Check out the jackass in the parachute pants" is a good icebreaker. Ted. Ted? Ted? Sorry, buddy, it's a "no" for me, too. Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called. Even they don't want those pants back. End flashback. They were insanely comfortable! They were like pajamas you could wear outside. Marshall, it's over. We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots. All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first. Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal. I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano, I don't think of Jeannie Radford, I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe. And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses. I remember when I was broke, just out of college, and I really needed a lamp. And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein. I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there. Creamsicle and turkey gravy, not at the same time. Well, that's adorable, but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see. The phone booth turns into Ted’s ex-girlfriend. I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes. How many has he made you? The lamp turns into Ted’s ex-girlfriend. He calls you "sweetie pie"? He called me "sweetie pie." The pillow turns into Ted’s ex-girlfriend. I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours. Really? You can't look at a pillow without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow! Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross. You're creepy and gross. Your mom's creepy and gross. Order! Order! I got to side with Robin. She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it. I've got to side with Ted. Just 'cause you still have something an ex girlfriend gave you doesn't mean you're holding onto her. All right, Barney. It all comes down to you. I side with Robin. What? Ted, your place is too cluttered. It's like you're living in a Bennigan's. Or a Danby's. What, they don't have Danby's in the US? Really? Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches? Just stop, sweetie. Ted is getting rid off his ex-girlfriends stuff. So I had no choice. I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends. It was painful, but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night. New York is famous for its theater, but there's many different levels. There's Broadway, off-Broadway, off-off-Broadway, homeless people screaming in the park, and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in. Ted, Robin and Barney arrive in the room where Lily’s going to play. Eight flights, of stairs. Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs? What kind of building is this? From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory. Where do you guys want to sit? I know where I don't want to sit. Guys, four together! I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke. Come on. It's not gonna be that bad. No? Okay. The lights turn off et the play starts. I... am... Rage! I... am Greed. I am Rage... Envy! I am outta here. No, you're not. You have to stay. This is the face of Consumerism! Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play. Hello, Greed, Rage...Envy... and Consumerism. I... am your father... America! 3 hours later the play is over. Oh, baby, that was wonderful! Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer. And when it became a play within a play, I was, like, "Now we are really cookin'!" Wow, Lily, that sucked! Barney! What? It was terrible. I mean, come on. You guys agree, right? Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends. No, friends make each other feel good. They build each other up and support them. That's what being a good friend is about. Yeah, if you're a Smurf. You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing and I would compliment you on it afterwards. Oh, really? You would? Yes. Bad move, Aldrin, bad move. We'll be starting our Q&amp;A with the director-- yours truly-- in five minutes right here. Barney runs out Robin and Ted arrive at Ted’s apartment. Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play? I know. He can be really insensitive. It was pretty bad, though. Oh, my God, it was so bad. Oh, my God, you've been robbed! Nope. All that stuff was from old girlfriends? Don't you buy anything for yourself? What can I say? Papa gets swag. And that should've been the end of it. But the next day... Ted is walking the dogs with Robin. You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff. But seeing how happy it makes you - totally worth it. Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have sex with you when I'm really tired. Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team. Well, sit. Sit, yeah. So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you? Nope. Well, except for my dogs. At Robin’s apartment. your past relationships. What's your point, Ted? Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment, and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends? What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends? I do now. That's ridiculous. I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you. Well, yeah, but not my dogs. You said everything. But not living things. Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away. Things with a heartbeat can stay. Enjoying this? Pickles, go get your ball. Go get your ball. Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you to make me get rid of all my stuff. Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs? The dog turns into a man. Guess what position we did it in. Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs. Um, no. Really? Well, I say we take it to the group, but I don't like your chances. They’re all at the bar. She's not getting rid of the dogs. What's the matter with you? Even I wouldn't do that. Yes! You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair, but not their dog. I miss Jebediah. Oh, I almost forgot. Flyers for my new play. Very funny. Oh, it's not a joke. It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night. And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long, I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends. Oh, we'll be there. Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong... Never. Good. Okay, I gotta go rehearse. Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho; the first three rows get wet. Robin and Ted are in Robin’s apartment. I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from. I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them. That was ridiculous. So we're-we're okay? Yeah, we're great. And I thought we were, but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play, Jealousy reared its ugly head. Robin has one of her dog in her knees but Ted sees a man instead. Oh, yeah, that's the spot. Robin and Ted are kissing on the bed when a man  interrupts them. Dude, I gotta pee. I gotta go. The gang is at Barney’s play. Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh? Yeah, he really is. It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs. Might be time to send them to the farm. You're gonna kill your dogs?! No! No, no, no, there really is a farm. My aunt has a farm upstate. Oh, thank God. Aw, you know, if I were five dogs, I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn. Yeah. I could visit them on weekends. My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty. Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs. "They"? What do you mean by "they"? Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate. Oh, look, it's starting. Shh! Are you sure you're gonna be okay? I mean, you know that this is gonna be... I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing, and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards. You know why? Because that's what friends do. Barney’s play starts. Moist. Moist. Moist. Moist. That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show. Moist. And then we endured about 20 minutes of this. Barney shoots at Lily with a water gun. I have to go refill. I'll be back in a moment. Play's not over. I never get picked for audience participation. And then it just got weird. Feelings. Inside. Oh, no! And when that didn't work... Okay! Stop! You win. Fine. Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show. Thank you, Lily. Is there anything you'd like to say about my show? No. No, I have nothing nice to say about your show. You were right, Barney. Let's go to the bar. Yes! I win! I love winning! Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily. I was just getting warmed up, man! Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go. Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful. It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it. Yeah, well, anyway. How about this, Barney? How about we stay and-and watch the rest of your show? It's your funeral. Five, six, one, two. So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half, 'cause that's what friends do, apparently. Ted is about te enter in his apartment. Hey. Where've you been? I called you earlier. I gave my dogs away to my aunt. You what? Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but... I think it's for the best. Wow. Oh, man. Can we go inside? Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar. Why? What's going on inside? Um, the floors are gone. What? Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed. This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail. Robin walks into the apartment and Ted brought back all his ex-girlfriends stuff. I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs! You said you threw all that stuff away! Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had. It was one of those fights that last for hours and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about. We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window. Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy. But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me, but somehow we got to here. We're really doing this? Yeah. At the bar… We're moving in together! During Barney’s play… The robot found love Confusing my circuitry My software's been hacked Toaster oven You're the one for me Two, three, four. Marshall stand up and slaps Barney. That's two. This is awesome. I can't believe this moment's finally here. One more mile and my little boy turns 200,000. Your baby Fiero's grown into a really old man Fiero. And just like an old man, he leaks fluid, smells stale, makes weird noises out the back. Yeah, he does. Hey, light up those cigars in the glove compartment. They're real Cubans. I got 'em in Chinatown last year just for this moment. Uh, Marshall, I'm not saying you were definitely ripped off, but these are chopsticks wrapped in napkins. What are you talking about? Whoa, pothole. The car stops. What? No. Oh. No. No, no, no. No, there's only .8 miles to go. Come on, buddy. Buddy! Is it cool if I still light these? CREDITS Kids, sometimes life forces us to be someone we didn't want to be. When that happens, we often try to hold on to a little piece of who we were. Maybe a tattoo. Or a piece of jewelry. A tiny souvenir that reminds us, "This is who I really am." Marshall's souvenir was not so tiny, but the more he found himself being pushed toward the corporate world and away from his dream of saving the environment, the tighter he held on to that Fiero. Ted and Marshall are in a garage. we're off the hook for the folding party today. Hey. It's very important to both Lily and me that there be a handmade origami crane in each of our wedding's... I couldn't even get through it.  Thank God. Hey, your car's going to be fine. This is the best auto shop around. Look at this certificate. One of the mechanics here finished a 64-ounce steak. Lily, Robin and Barney arrive at the garage. Surprise. We felt bad that you guys were missing the super-fun origami folding party, so... we suggested moving it here. We insisted. Terrific. How's the Fiero? She's still in triage. She? I thought it was your little boy. Oh, it goes back and forth. It's sort of a tranny car. How long have you had her... slash him? My brothers handed it down to me when I was 16. Oh, how nice of them. Not really. Flashback. Marshall is in the front of his house with his brothers. Congratulations. The Fiero is yours. If you pass the final test. Come on! I already shaved my legs and swallowed five dollars in quarters. Only $4.50 has come out. Just go to the Weinerburger drive-thru and get us 12 cups of coffee. That's it? Oh, yeah. But we get to decide what you wear. Agreed. Totally agreed. Marshall is in a drive-in naked in his car. You're naked. I'm aware of that. You have 50 cents? No... Look,  can I just have my coffee, please? Sorry, we're all out of trays and lids. Two tall guys just came through here a few minutes ago and bought 'em all. Marshall puts the cups of coffee in the car, then his brothers jump at him to scare him, so Marshall stops the car and because of it all the cups of coffee fall on him and it burns him. End of flashback. And that is the origin of Marshall's insane "no food or drinks in the Fiero, not even groceries" rule. It is not insane. Barney. That's like the third one in a row that you've screwed up. Well, I'm trying, but it's... Look. You fold twice to the middle, fold back and forth, pull the ends out, flip over, open the flaps, fold the edges, crease the front, fold in half, fold the wings down, push in the bottom corners, and fold the wings back out. Or would you like one of my kindergartners to show you? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I think I've got it. No. Forget it; the paper's too expensive. You're out. Aw, nerts. The food rule is insane. We could have died because of it. Remember the 100K fiasco? Ah, the Fiero-asco. Dude, I told you that doesn't work. It's the 100K fiasco. What's the 100K fiasco? The Fiero-asco? It was just before winter break our freshman year of college. Marshall and I were roommates, but we weren't really good friends yet. I thought Ted was a little bit pretentious. And Marshall was a total slob. Flashback. College. Marshall comes in the room while Ted’s on the bed reading. Hey  I'm driving my Fiero back over break. I know we see enough of each other as it is, but if you want a ride, I could use the gas money. You live in Ohio, right? I could swing through and pick you up. All right, first of all, my parents live in Ohio. I live in the moment. Plus, Karen and I haven't seen each other since Thanksgiving. We're both really invested in making this long-distance thing work, so... All right, well, call me if you change your mind. My odometer's going to hit 100K. She'd be so bummed if I left early. In Marshall’s car… It was totally mutual. I mean, Karen brought it up first, but I... it was... it was totally mutual. I hear you. So what's up with you and Lily? Anything serious Yeah. Dude, we're college freshmen. I'm not going to get tied down by the first chick I hook up with. Lily's cool, but this bird you'll never chain, you know? The next few hours of our drive were classic road trip. So... this song. Oh, it's the best song in the world. It's the only song I like. Just kidding. Tape's been stuck in the player for, like, two years. Better than nothing, though. Maybe. I am so... sick... of this song. Don't worry. It comes around again. What do you mean? Just to be the man who walks 1,000 miles And falls down at your door... Yeah, we totally nailed the ending. That was probably our best one. Hey, you want to play Zitch Dog? What? Uh, it's a car game. Every time you see a dog, you got to be the first one to say, "Zitch dog." I'm pretty good, so... Zitch dog. Well, no, I didn't know we had...we'd started, but... Okay, that's cool. You got the first point. Zitch dog. Zitch dog. Damn it! Are we still playing? ‘Cause I wasn't... I wasn't really... 12-nothing. Marshall’s sleeping and Ted driving. Marshall. Marshall. Zitch dog, blue Suburban. Damn it! 18-nothing. Then Marshall, who was so busy cheating at Zitch Dog, got us totally lost. Where the hell are we?! End of flashback. In the garage. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. I think you skipped something. Really? Seems impossible. Flashback. Ted’s driving the car… Hey, we got some time. What do you say we get off the highway, take the road less traveled, you know? Robert Frost. Doesn't seem like a smart idea. Too late. I'm taking this exit. Who's not fun enough now, Karen? Then we got lost. Where the hell are we?! I'm pulling over. No, keep driving. We're almost out of gas, and we might not even be on a road anymore. It's below zero out. If we pull over, we could be snowed in for days. Plus, I only have, like, six granola bars and three bottles of water. Nah, I threw them out. What?! No food or drink in the Fiero. Thus began the longest night of our lives. Pretty sure that my foot is frozen solid. Marshall... there's a very real chance that we're gonna be snowed in here for days. If I die first, do whatever you need to survive. Eat my flesh. Slice me open like a tauntaun, whatever. Thanks, Ted. You're a good friend. And if I die first, you just leave my body alone. What? I just said you could cut me open and crawl inside me. Yeah, don't do any of that stuff to me; it skeeves me out. But... but you're dead, and I'm gonna die if I don't. Wasn't an easy decision. This is all because of your insane no-food rule. It's perfectly rational. They start fighting. Hey! My spectacles! Hey. I know we're low on gas, but can we turn on the heat for just a minute? Okay. Dude... I hate to say this... but it's so cold... there's only one way that we're gonna make it through this night. We should've kept driving. Come on, Marshall. No. No. We might die now. I may never see Lily again. I never told anybody this, but... I've known for a long time that I'm gonna marry that girl. If we survive this, someday I'm gonna marry her. I'm sorry about your spectacles. That's okay. They were decorative. Hey, Marshall. Yeah? Are you still thinking about Lily? Yeah. Please stop. And so Marshall and I thought we were gonna die out there in the middle of nowhere. But funny thing... Ted and Marshall are sleeping in the car which is next to a hotel. A man knocks onthe window. Hey. You lovers better just keep on driving. Zitch dog! Damn it! End of flashback. In the garage… You said you were gonna marry me that long ago? That is so sweet. That trip is when Marshall and I became best friends. With privileges, from the sound of it. Eriksen. Wow. Looks like he really needs a hug. Ted. He said it would be at least 3,000 bucks to make it run again. And even then, there's no guarantee. Well, it's a pretty old car. Yeah. You can keep prolonging its life, but it's really mostly machine at this point. I know that it's a lot of money, but it's my Fiero, you know? I'm about to graduate and take some sellout corporate law job, and without that Fiero, I'm just another guy in a suit. How dare you... Hey. I've been through so much in that car. The suicidal cat. Marshall are kissing in the car when a cat jumps in the roof. Hitchhiking Waldo. The homeless guy who broke in through the window and threw up all over the backseat. Lily, don't. Be strong. Do not go all "prisoner's dilemma" on me. The car's on its deathbed, Robin. I have to clear my conscience. Guys, what are you talking about? Okay. Shortly after we met Robin, she and I were jonesing for Thai food from this one place. Flashback. In Ted’s apartment… An hour and a half delivery. We can't wait that long. I wish we could take the Fiero, but Marshall has this insane no-food rule. But Thai food, Lily. Pad Yum Mao. Tom Kai Gah. Thai See Ran. Oh! You're just saying random syllables, and it still sounds delicious. Okay. Here's what we'll do. We'll drive over, pick it up, have them double-bag it, very carefully drive it back here with the windows open, and he'll never know. . Wow, these brakes are really sensitive. Oh, Marshall is gonna kill me! This and the difference between "affect" and "effect" are the only two things he's really serious about. Lily, it's gonna be fine. No, it's not. Marshall's gonna freak. Oh, God, oh, God. What are we gonna do? Oh, God, oh...! Shut up! Now, listen to me. The clock is ticking. Okay, first thing, we scoop up all these little pieces of tofu and cabbage. Next, what we need to take care of are the really messy parts-- the pools that have collected. We got to soak that soup up. Last is the smell. We got to cover up that Tom Kah Gai. You mentioned cigars. There's two in the glove compartment, but he's been saving them. Hand me those chopsticks. Hey, how about some tunes? Oh, great song. These cigars aren't helping at all. Yeah. This was a terrible idea. Now it just smells like a homeless guy threw up in here. End of flasback. The broken windows? We had to make it look realistic. Why did you break two of them? It looked like fun when she did it.  So I wanted to try. Can't believe this whole time it was you guys. I've been blaming really tanned dancing leotard guy. Marshall, I'm so sorry, but sharing that secret-- that's when Robin and I became best friends. Wow. What a special car. So, can I crush it into a little cube yet? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Come on, Marshall. This is your Fiero. You know the rightthing to do here. Wow, Barney, why do you love that car so much? Love it? Hold on a second. Love it? I hate it! What? Why? Why? Why? Why?! Why?! Let me tell it. It was last year during the transit strike. Flasback. Barney comes into Ted’s apartment. Hey. Hey. Uh, is Marshall around? I have a massage in Queens in half an hour. I need a ride. Uh, no, he's at the library all day. Just take the keys. Hey! Why don't you drive me? It'll be like a total road trip. To Queens? Yeah, we'll get, we'll get beef jerky, Triscuits. Uh, actually I have a lot of work to do, so. Okay. Well, anyway, I'll cancel. See you later. Wait! You know how to drive, right? What, of course I know how to drive. I love driving. Hitting the road. Cruising the lanes. And braking. Honking. Love it. Except for lady drivers. Don't get me started on lady drivers. Which pedal's the gas? Trick question. No, it's not Yes, it is. No, it's not. Middle, left, right? I never learned how to drive! I grew up in the city. I never had a chance. Well, guess what? You're getting your chance. Because I'm going to teach you. Barney Stinson, buckle up. Barney’s driving and Ted’s teaching him. This isn't right. God never meant for us to travel at such breakneck speeds. Relax. You're doing great. Ignore the old lady on the rascal; this isn't a race. Dude, a dog. Zitch dogs, this. Or nothing. What do I do? Tell me what to do, Ted. Step on the brakes. Sometime in the next 20 minutes. Which? Which one's the break again? The left one. Left. Oh, man, left. I'm totally blanking. Make the Ls Oh, we're not going to make it. Why did you just turn on the radio? I don't know why I turned on the radio! We're going to die. Tell me what to do, Ted. Relax. You're being crazy. Help me, Ted! I'm being serious. Stop, drop and roll. Screaming is fun! Screaming is fun! I can't move. I can't... I can't feel my... Wait. Wait. We're okay. We're okay. We're okay. It's a miracle, Ted! End of flaxhback. Wow. Sounds like you had some accident in that car. Actually, he had two accidents if you add the fact that he... ummina-hummina-hummina-hummina ummina-hummina-hummina hummina. I shouldn't even be here, thanks to that deathtrap. But fate... fate gave me a second chance. And helped me realize that our days on this planet are too few to squander. So I decided from that moment on to continue living life to its fullest. So you made a life-changing decision to not change your life at all. True story. Guys. This Fiero's meant a lot to all of us. Friendships were made. Adventures had. Horrors faced. That's why we have to get rid of it. Yes! What? But 200,000... But that's life. You know? You never end up where you thought you wanted to be. I'm not helping the environment. Ted's not a philosopher. Lily's not not a world-famous artist. Barney's never driven more than ten miles an hour. Robin, I'm sure, has also experience disappointment in her life. Maybe? And my Fiero's not a Fiero that went 200,000 miles. It's okay. You know? Those are old dreams. We'll get a new car and we'll fill that one up with new memories. And that'll be the car we had when we were first married. When we owned our first house. Maybe even the first car our four kids remember. That's so sweet. The first car our two kids remember. I would like to say good-bye. Marshall is in the car and the other are around it. Marshall taps the dashboard and the cassette goes out. You know what? This Fiero, it's effected all our lives. Affected. That's what I said. Just making sure. Got us all a lot of places. I mean maybe it's time we return the favor. This Fiero should have made it to 200,000. So, let's get it out that door. And we'll push it the last .7 miles. It'd do the same for us. Marshall puts the cassette back in and they all start to push. Hey, geniuses. The back wheels are on blocks. That car ain't going anywhere. Close enough! Close enough! And so Marshall said good-bye to his Fiero. And as the car's final gift to us all, the money he got for scrap parts paid our bar tab for the next two nights. At the bar… May you rust in peace. Rot in hell, devil steed. And what better friend is there than that? Flashback. Marshall and his brother are in the Fiero. Bro. Have you heard this new song? I just got the cassingle. Put it in. I am never going to get sick of this song. Never, ever, never, never, ever. Yeah! Marshall, Lily, Ted and Barney are at the bar. 00 am. Does that sound good to everybody? By the way, what are you guys doing with Ted's room? 'Cause if you need help with the rent, I'll take it. Why would you want to live with us? I don't call what you guys do "living." Here's the deal, I need a room closer to the bar. It takes me exactly 23 minutes to get a girl from the bar back to my apartment. A lot can go wrong in 23 minutes. Flashback. Barney’s in a cab with a girl. This is going to be so hot. The girl falls asleep. She's paying. Barney goes out oft he cab. Barney’s in a cab with another girl. I swear, if he doesn't call me back, I'm going to go through with this. Please hurry, sir. I want to do dirty stuff with you. Stuff I won't let him do. Every red light run is an extra $20. Baby? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It was all my fault. Barney’s still in a cab with another girl. I am so drunk. When I'm this drunk, I go crazy! I bet you do. Check this out. What up NYPD? So close. End of flashback. Back tot he bar. See? If I had a room here all I have to do is get them upstairs. Come on, guys. It'll be great! We'll come in after you guys are asleep and I'll be gone before you wake up. So, you get to have sex and we get to wake some skanky girl up in the morning and kick her out? God, Lily. Some guy just told her that he loved her then pretended to go to the bathroom and never came back you can't make her a cup of coffee? Real nice. CREDITS Ted is putting his stuff in the moving truck. I put all your heavy jackets in this box marked "winter." And all your colorful sweaters in this box marked "Bill Cosby." Make fun, but America loved that guy for a reason. Wow! Almost done. Not so fast. Take your sword. Wow. End of an era. Yeah. It's a bummer to break up the set, but you're going to need that sword. It's true my building is infested with dragons. Looks like our little boy is finally moving out. It seems like just yesterday he was a cute little freshmen. Discovering Reggae and ultimate Frisbee. He did it later than the other kids but we never pushed him. We knew he'd get there. You haven't moved in yet, have you? Good. You guys have to take this quiz. I found it in a magazine. It's called the "Are you ready to move in together?" quiz. Well, if it's anything like you're "Are you wearing panties" quiz, I'm out. Question one, Ted, "Do you want to move in with Robin?" Mm. Yes. Oh, you got the first one wrong. The answer is "no," you secretly want to be single and hang out with your awesome friend Barney." Question two. Robin, "Do you think you can score a hotter guy than Ted?" Correct. The answer was awkward silence. Question three, "Did I just make up this quiz to prove a point?" Yes. Yes, I did. Really? You mean it's not from Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine? So? We all agree? We move Ted's stuff back up here? Mm... no. We're still moving in together. Why? This is crazy. Ted you're throwing your life away. This girl is blinding you. With her shiny hair and her boobed shaped boobs. This is bad for you, too, you know. How are you going to feel when he sees you without any makeup? I'm not wearing makeup right now. Holy crap, you're beautiful. All right then, how will you feel when you can't sneak the occasional cigarette? Oh, come on, Robin doesn't smoke. Wait, do you? Of course not. Why? Don't tell me how to live my life! Ted, I can't let you do this. Come on. This is happening. So instead of fighting it why, why don't you just help? You want me to help you? Yeah. Okay, Ted. I'll help you. Can't believe we actually got him to take a box down. Maybe he's finally getting on board. Ted, Lily, Marshall and Lily are on the street. Where's the truck? Where's Barney? Wait for it. I can't believe this! Everything I own in the world is in there. Except for this box of pot lids. And the sword. I'm going to kill him. I swear to God I'm going to kill him! Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that. For now. Marshall and Lily are back at the apartment. Marshall, we live alone. This is so great! We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone. Oh, I know what I want to start with. They’re both sitting in the couch, naked… So, here we are, right? Sitting around the apartment naked.Awesome. Yep. It's not as awesome as I thought it would be. My butt itches. I'm cold. I noticed. Yeah, like you're one to talk, Pointy. Ted’s at Robin’s apartment on the phone.. Barney, I don't know if you got my other 47 messages, but if my stuff isn't here within the hour I'm calling the cops. This is the last time I'm calling you. Because my charger's in the back of the truck. Don't worry, it's Barney. He'll bring the stuff back. No, it's just... I was really looking forward to settling in, you know? Maybe setting up my TV. Watching a movie in bed. What? Do we really want a TV in the bedroom? I thought we did. I'm not sure that we do. Well, where else would we put my TV? We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement. But wouldn't we miss my TV? Would we? Yes, we would. We've had that TV for a long time and we would feel more at home if it were setup in our bedroom. We need wine, don't we? Yes, we do. Marshall and Lily are kissing in the couch. Should we, um, move this to the bedroom? Why? Ted doesn't live here anymore. We can do it wherever we want. You know what else? We don't have to be quiet anymore. We can be as loud as we want. Okay, I think we need to lay down some ground rules. Just because we can be loud doesn't mean we have to be loud. And although it might turn you on, you screaming, "I'm the best," doesn't do much for me. Well, it's a lot better than yelling, "Ted's not here," over and over again. Well, at least what I said is true. Well, that was unnecessary. At Robin’s apartment… Well, since I only have one box I figure I might as well unpack it. Mm, where do you think we should put it? Well, unless you have a separate pot lid room, I was thinking the cupboard. What? Uh, the thing is my kitchen is kind of small. And, um, I already have a bunch of pot lids and mine come with pots, so... You're saying there's no way to make room for the single box of stuff I try to move into our place? Well, why don't you just take it down to the... Do not say storage space. I was going to say Dumpster. Damn it, Robin, this is all I have left in the world-- eight pot lids and a sword. Yeah, about the sword. Ted answers his phone. Hello. Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby. Barney, I know it's you. Where's my stuff? It's not me. If you want to see your precious possessions again, put on the suit. What suit? Ding-dong. Oh, what's that? The doorbell. That's the suit I'm talking about. I haven't gotten to the door yet. Oh, okay, let me know when you get there. Okay, I opened it. And there's a suit there. That's the suit I'm talking about. Barney.... This isn't Barney. But I hear that guy's awesome. All right. Listen very carefully. You will get your stuff back if you are able to complete a series of challenges. Number one, put on the suit. Number two, meet me at McClaren's in an hour. How will I know who to look for since we've never met? I look like Barney. Ted meets Barney at Mclaren’s Oh, hey, Ted. Suit and sneakers. A little Ellen DeGeneres but you pull it off. I don't have any other shoes because you stole them along with everything else I own in the world. Where's the truck, Barney? Barney. People's whose trucks I'm not holding for ransom call me Barney. I think you should call me The Commodore. I'm not calling you... You're not getting your stuff back. Can I please have my stuff back... The Commodore? No. Here's the deal, Ted, you're my bro. And you're about to become a henpecked, beaten down, shell of a man. So tonight, we are going to have one last awesome night together as bros. It's a bro-ing away party. A special bro-casion. A bro-choice rally. Bro-time at the Apollo. Oh, bro me. Well, so what do I have to do? No, it's not what you have to do, it's what you want to do, and you want to have a good time before you go take Fun Ted out back and shoot him. So... first thing on the docket... get me that girl's number. Absolutely not. if I was all your stuff, would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson? Ted gets up. Hey, look, world's strongest man is on. Ooh, it's the one where Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus from the Partridge family with his teeth. It's the best one. Hey, Ted, get in... We live alone. Yay. Back at the bar where Ted end Barney are with a girl. Well, I win. You need to give my friend your phone number. Wow, I really didn't think Lou Ferrigno could pull that bus. Are you sure this is live? It looks pretty old. Yeah, that's 'cause the, uh, TV is old. The girl writes down her number. So, I'll, uh, call you tomorrow? Yeah. Um, not too early. I have church. You were impressive, buddy. Nice work. All right, next challenge. No. No next challenge. Look, this is my first night living with Robin. She's probably pissed I'm spending it out with you. Robin’s taking a bath and smoking… This might be our last hurrah, my little friend. At the apartment… Marshall, I am gonna cook you the best dinner of your life. How would you like a... one-egg omelet with some ketchup and film? Guess Ted's the one who did the shopping. Ooh, look, a microwave pizza! Guess the microwave was Ted's, too. Yeah. So were all the towels. Turns out that everything that was useful in this apartment was Ted's. Everything that was a Foghat poster we bought ironically in college was mine. Marshall. Yeah, baby? I miss Ted. Is it too soon to call him? No, we shouldn't. I don't want to interrupt his first night living with Robin. Ted and Barney are playing Laser Tag… Ha, nice shooting. You know, if we win this one it's free onion rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack. What a bargain. We only had to spend 20 bucks a game. Admit it, you're having fun. Maybe. I mean, it was pretty funny when that little girl fell over that space barrel. Nice... We win. Oh, walk of shame, walk of game-- what up? Okay. Let's go one more. I don't know. You know you want to. All right, let's do it-- I just got to call Robin real quick. Oh, so that's what it's gonna be like from now on? No. Okay, okay. You call your old lady and ask permission to have fun. Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating our victory onion rings Han style. Solo. Hey, Ted. Hey, sweetie listen, I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be pretty late, so don't wait up. Oh, it's totally fine. You do what you got to do. Thanks. You're the best. I love you. Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for holding. Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel my subscription to Guns and Ammo, that would be great. No, it's a great magazine. Really great. They've printed three of my letters. It's just that my boyfriend is moving in and he kind of doesn't approve of the whole gun thing. A free hand grenade phone? You know what? Let me give you my work address. Marshall comes into the apartment full of bags. I did it, baby! I got beer. I got food. We don't need Ted anymore. I am the provider of this apartment now, and I have provided! "Provode"? Provided. Anyway, I got us everything we need. Could you toss me the toilet paper? Be right back, baby. Sit tight. At the bar… Hey, I got to admit, um... I didn't think I would, but, uh... I had a really good time tonight. You're a good friend, Barney. Hey, man, why don't you, uh... why don't you tell me where my truck is. No, I don't think so. Where's my truck?! Do you know why I haven't given you any of your possessions back yet? Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk of the British Royal Douchery? Because you don't want them back. You could've left at any time tonight, but you didn't, Ted. Why is that? Because I didn't want to go back to Robin's without my stuff. False. You know what I think? I think you spent one day with her and it already sucked. I think you didn't like being there, she didn't like having you there and you both realized that you made a huge mistake. And that's why you spent your first night living with Robin out playing laser tag with me. And that's why three seconds ago you didn't call it "my place" or "our place" or "home," you called it "Robin's." You know what? You can keep my stuff. At Robin’s place… Hey. Hey, did you get the truck back? No. Why not? What happened? Oh, he pissed me off so much, I left. Anyway, I just wanted to come back here, space out and watch a movie. Do you anything that wasn't made by John Woo? Why, do you? You know, forget the movie. I just want to sit. What? It's just I eat at that table. Fine, I'll take my shoes off. You know, why don't you just throw me down in the storage space where you have room for me. Ted, come on. No, you come on. I had to jump through hoops all night for Barney and then it took me an hour to get home because this place is so far away from the bar. Oh, my God. What? I know where Barney put my truck. At the bar. Barney’s with a girl… Let's go back to my place. I bet you my place is closer. Here we are. You live in the loading dock behind the bar? I don't live here, baby. This is just my ride. No, no, no, no. I'm not getting into any van, I've seen Silence of the Lambs. Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne in the back of a moving van. Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are. Those other Rockettes who called you slow are crazy. They start kissing and the truck moves. Oh, my God. I knew it. You're kidnapping me. Help! Help! No, no, no, no. I can explain.  Hello? Enjoying the ride? Ted? Ted, you let us out of here. You let us out of here this instant! This isn't Ted. But I hear that guy's awesome. Ted and Robin are sitting in the stairs in front of the apartment. So I took Sara home and I took Barney to a bar near his apartment. Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him. That poor girl must've been so confused. Yeah. Well, at least Barney learned a valuable lesson. You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a Rockette. So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked. Yeah. Yeah, I guess we should. Marshall and Lily are sitting in the couch. Lily... deep within the Amazonian rainforest, there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree. It cannot survive without this tree. It is supported... by this tree. Lily, we are that tree. The inside tree or the outside tree? The outside tree. Shouldn't there be three trees? You and I are one tree. Okay, look, Lily, the point is that we grew around Ted and without him, we're slowly dying. What do we do? I think we can marry each other. But we also have to marry Ted. I'll tell you right now, my Dad is not gonna pay for that wedding. Ted comes in the apartment. Ted! What are you doing here? Robin and I aren't gonna move in together after all. What happened? Flashback. Ted and Robin are sitting in the stairs in front on the apartment. I thought we decided we were ready? I know. How did we come to that again? I don't remember. We were fighting? It's all so blurry. Yeah. The "let's move in together" sex was pretty amazing. I know. I did that thing with no hands I normally need both to do. You know... I'm really happy with you. I‘m really happy with you. The way things are. Maybe we shouldn't mess with that. I don't know that we should. Hey... I hear the "let's not move in together" sex is pretty incredible. Let's go back to my place. Ted opens the back of the moving truck. Ooh, thank you. You're welcome. No, thank you. You'll be very happy. End of flashback. Look, I know you guys are really excited about having the place to yourself. Until after the wedding, I mean, if it's not too much of an imposition... Marshall and Lily hug Ted. God, this feels so right. Never leave us again. Guys, Robin's down in the truck and there's actually a lot of boxes, so maybe we should... At the bar… top ten things I would've called my truck... It was never your truck. ...if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back. It was a rental. Number ten, "The Winne-Bango." Number nine, "The Pick-Up Truck." Number eight, "The Ford Explore Her." Number seven, "The You Scream Truck." You Scream. Number six, "Feels On Wheels." Hello! Number five, "The Ride Her Truck." Number four, "The 18-Squeeler." Number three, "The Esca-Laid." Number two, "The Slam-Boney." and... the number one thing I would've called my truck if Ted hadn't been a jerk and given it back... "The '69 Chevy." Barney rises his hands and hits the waitress. Sorry. Flashback. At the bar… Hey. What are you guys talking about? Lily. I got to go. End of flashback. But when times are good, it's impossible to get rid of him. At the bar… What are you guys doing? We just finished planning Marshall's bachelor party. Good, you haven't started yet. Let's talk logistics. Now, have you laid out ground rules with Lily? Where you are or aren't allowed to touch or be touched? Show me on Ted. Actually, we're, uh, we're thinking of skipping the strippers. You... you want to have a party without strippers. Flasback. Ted  This was the worse thing I could have said. You see, uncle Barney loved cooking up bachelor parties. And it was always the same recipe. You start with a slightly cramped hotel suite. Arrange the chairs in a circle... Fill them with your closest friends. Turn the heat up to about 90. Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke. And then, right in the middle of the room, you throw in a girl. But not a beautiful girl-- no, if this girl was ever beautiful, it was two kids, three tattoos and one pesky substance abuse problem ago. Which one of you is Stuart? Please, I really don't want to do this. Shut up, put in your mouth guard. Then she proceeds to do things that demean the groom, herself and really, the entire human race. Disgusting. Ah, horrifying. Classic. Oh, please, please, no, no. Enf of flashback. I don't want anything like that happening to me. Stuart's still trying to forget that night. It's my bachelor party. We're not having strippers. Oh, he thinks he has a sain it. So, strippers it is! Now, just, uh, tell me where we're going to be and I'll make some calls. I think I can get the fourth one for free. Quick question. Prosthetic arm. Deal breaker? Barney, there is... Before you say no, it has attachments. CREDITS Look, I know you have some stuff planned for Marshall's bachelor party, but he really doesn't want strippers. Yes, he does. Uh, well, he told me he doesn't. Uh, well, he told me he does. When? Every minute of every day as his inner animal thrashes against the cage of his own puritanical upbringing. Or do you guys not like naked girls. Um, we love naked girls. They're one of the best things in the world. It goes... naked girls, democracy, the scene in Every Which Way But Loose where the monkey gives a guy the finger. We just don't like your naked girls. What, my girls aren't hot enough? I mean, all right, fine, the stripper at Stuart's bachelor party was a 15. She was 15? No, a 15. Like in blackjack. As in, not sure whether you'd hit it? Exactly. Nice. This is important to Marshall. So, promise me, no strippers. All right, I promise. I'm serious. So am I. No strippers. Now say it without winking. No strippers. You just winked. No I didn't. The guys are in the car. So, when the day arrived, we all climbed into a rented Escalade and set out. Now, every bachelor party is usually made up of the same stock characters. You've got the groom… the best man... the guy who speaks only in clichées... Dead man walking! ...the guy who disappears at the beginning of the night and doesn't show up again until the end. All right, who's up for a little blackjack before we check in. No, no, no. None for me. See you guys back at the room, then. And, of course, well... Barney. Every bachelor party has a Barney. Oh, what's this? This car has a DVD player? You mean, we could have been watching these pornos the whole time? Yeah. This one's in HD. This one's in H-double-D. Oh! That same night, aunt Lily was having a wedding shower. And Robin showed up gift in hand. Funny story about that gift. Flashback. Robin and Barney are at the bar. Hey, Barney, check out what I got Lily for her shower. It's kind of racy. Think you can handle it? Uh, I've been in a ten-way. So, yeah. It's kind of see-through. Whoa, ho ho! You weren't kidding! You know when you should give that to her? 1850. Robin, it's her bridal shower! All her friends are gonna be there, they're going to be drinking. You need to get her something daring, something outrageous. Well, what do you think I should get her? There's a store on Eighth Avenue that specializes in-- how to put this delicately? uh, battery-powered, adult- recreational fake penises. And so Aunt Robin went to a store on Eighth Avenue, and a battery powered, adult-recreational... Well, it was something inappropriate. And we're back in. End of flashback. Robin comes into the apartment. Robin! I'm so glad you're here. Come in, I want you to meet everybody. Robin, this is my Grandma Lois and my Aunt Florence. Oh, lovely to meet you, dear. They put this whole party together. It's different from what I expected, but lovely. Lovely. And oh, look, there are little kids here! Yeah, my cousins. Listen, I, uh, I forgot something somewhere so I'm going to just go... Robin, this is my mom, Janice. Oh, honey. I'm so glad to finally meet you. Me too. I, I've heard so much about you. Me, too. Oh, here. Let me take your gift. Can I guess what it is? Is it a, a, a mini food processor? No. No? Oh. Oh, give me a hint. What color is it? Black. Well, I guess I'm just going to have to wait and see! Oh, great. Robin... this is my Cousin Margaret. Oh, finally, someone our own age! Wait, do I introduce you as "Cousin Margaret" or "Sister Margaret?" Well, I'm not officially confirmed as a nun until next month and I don't want to tick off the Big Guy, so let's stick with "Cousin" for now. God's watching. Excellent! In the car… Man, they spent a lot of money on this porno. Whoa-- Morgan Freeman? Man, that guy's in everything. Aw, man, I grabbed the wrong Deep Impact! No, leave it in, it's a good movie. But, dude, there's no sex in it. Yeah, just like marriage. Huh? Right? Oh, oh, hey, check this out! Don't ask how, but I procured for us five loco bueno, hand-rolled, highly illegal Cubans. Seriously, you could go to jail for smoking these things. Marriage is like jail! Right, fellas?! But at least in jail, you get to have sex! But we're not lighting these babies up, till we get to the A.C. A.C.? Um, Atlantic City. Try to keep up, Brad. We're not going to Atlantic City. Just a second, Brad. Hi. Hi. We're still going to Atlantic City, right? Oh, did I not tell you? Yeah, we switched it. We're going to Foxwoods. Foxwoods? But I've got an ipperstray waiting in tlanticaay itycay. What the heck's in Foxwoods? Well, we've got five third row seats to the Popinski-Salazar rematch. They've set aside our very own craps table, and I reserved a private room for us at Connelly's, where the five of us are going to be sharing a 102-ounce steak from a cow that I picked out on the Internet. Yeah. Great. The night's ruined. Sorry, Barney. It was an honest mistake. They arrive at the hotel. This is going to be great! Meat, violence, throwing money down the toilet. America-- one; every other country-- zero. Thanks, guys. Yeah. You okay, Barney? What can I say, Ted? You won. Ted opens the hotel room and a girl is there. Hi. You one... sad, pathetic loser. Boys, say hello to Treasure. Hi, Treasure. I can't believe that you did this. I had to. I'm your best man. Ted's my best man. You've yet to make a decision and that's fine. But as your best-man-to-be, it's my job to make sure at your bachelor party you see a woman take her clothes off while dancing to Whitesnake's "Here I Go Again." All right, fine, but... let's make it fast, all right. The fight starts in an hour we don't want to miss it. It's a girl taking her clothes off. How long can it take? It's a bit more complicated than that. I need two grounded sockets, a large sterile pot filled with hot water and you all need to sign these releases. At the apartment… An egg beater! Aw, thank you, Aunt Sylvia! I love that it's cordless. Well, at least I got that part right. All of these gifts are so thoughtful. Lily? I need you to look at me right now and read my mind. Oh, my God! You're hearing me! Yeah! Sorry this party's so boring. What's up? Do not open my gift. See what I'm doing here? I'm looking over at the gift, then back at you, and I'm shaking my head, "no." Gift. You. No. Are you getting that? I totally got it. Here you go. Lily said it was your time of the month. You're welcome. What are you doing? Oh, just, um... rearranging the gifts. The pile looked a bit precarious. So... Oh, don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it. Great. You do that. You're gonna make a damn good nun. As many times as Robin told this story over the years, she would never quite be able to explain the logic of her next move. Robin exchange her giftcard with another one. Guys are sitting in the chair while the stripper does her show. Is this a strip show or a Kiss concert? Shh! She's starting. Please turn off your cell phones, pagers and sense of shame. All right, boys. Lie back, get comfortable, and enjoy the show. Of course there's no way I'm telling you about her show. So, let's skip ahead a little. One minute later… Ow! Oh my God, are you all right? No, I am not all right, you idiot. My ankle is broken! Take me to the hospital! Um, actually, we have tickets. You know what? Thanks a lot, Barney. She told you at the beginning of the show not to use the smoke machine when she's on the hippity hop. Now I'm going to have to spend the rest of my bachelor party in a hospital. Well, hey, maybe we'll get to see her X-rays. The ultimate strip show. X-rays. More like triple X-rays. Just stop. In the car… Which exit is the hospital? What if she doesn't make it to the hospital? Barney, please calm down. Maybe we should just take her to the desert, bury her and wash our hands of this whole thing! Dude, what is the matter with you? I'm just trying to illustrate to Marshall that as his best man... You're not my best man. As his best man, I would help him bury a hooker in the desert. I'm not a hooker. And you're not my best man. You've ruined my bachelor party. I don't know why you wouldn't just listen to me when I said I didn't want this. Well, the fight started ten minutes ago. Maybe-maybe we should listen. Oh, Doctor, what a fight! That knockout will be talked about for years to come! Anyone lucky enough to be in the arena tonight just witnessed boxing history in the making! At the apartment… Thank you so much, Margaret. I can't believe you carved that crucifix yourself. So talented. Didn't think you could carve. For you. Oh. And this one's from... Grandma Lois. Oh. No, wait, darling. Before you open this, I-I want to say a few words. Okay, something you need to know. Grandma Lois thought she was giving her granddaughter an antique sewing machine. And we're back in. Honey, this handy little device has been in our family for generations. I used it, your great grandmother used it. Now, her mother didn't use this one, but she used one just like it. Of course, back then, they were made out of wood. And, uh, I guess before that, you just had to do it by hand. Would you pass the wine, please? No. The guys are at the hospital… Hey, Marshall, while we're here, you may as well go down to the morgue and climb into a drawer, 'cause that's what marriage is like. Can I get an amen? Is everything all right at home, Stuart? No. It's broken. Oh, damn it, this is bad. I really can't lose this job. My daughters are about to start school, and my fiancée, well... ever since he got back from Iraq, pretty much all he does is drink. I think about leaving him, but... I don't want my girls growing up without a dad like I did. I don't want them to know what that's like. So, show time? What is the matter with you? Her ankle's broken. I know for a fact that the second half of her act takes place largely in a seated or supine position. Oh, that's true. Treasure, please, don't worry about the show. Uh, we'd feel bad. What does that mean? No. We just mean, uh, you're off the hook. You don't have to do it. I don't have to do it? Well, guess what? I know I don't have to do it. I do it because I am good at it. Look, I don't need your pity. All I want to do is give you a great show because you're getting married! Is that so much to ask? Is that such a major inconvenience?! They’re back at the hotel and Treasure starts her show. Oh, that is wrong. Oh, that's just so wrong. Well, the doctor did say for her to keep it elevated. At the apartment… When I was a girl, my mother taught me and my sister to use it. We used to have contests to see who could finish faster. It was so exciting. The whole family would gather around to watch. And when I was a new bride, this is what kept me buzy all those long nights when your grandfather was in Korea. And speaking of your grandfather, though I don't think he'd care to admit this to any of his army buddies, but... he'd have a go at it every once in a while. And he enjoyed it. Oh, open it up, sweetie. May this give for you as much joy as it's brought me. Grandma, um... Wow. Well, take it out, honey. I want to show you how to use it. Okay, no, no! Don't take it out. Lily, that's not your grandma's gift. It's mine. I panicked, and I switched the cards because I was embarrassed. Well, what is it? It's just like the one Miranda gave to Charlotte on Sex and the City. Oh, I love that show. I always watch it on TBS. Oh, you would. You're such a Samantha! Oh, I'm a Carrie! You're a Samantha! And then the night became a whole new kind of uncomfortable. So where do I get one of these? Mom! Marshall, Ted, Barney and Stuart are at the restaurant… Man, what a show, huh? She did some disgusting stuff. Really sticks with you. I may be done eating. Me, too. I mean, like, forever. Me, too. I miss my wife. Hey, let's go around the table and say what our favorite part was. Mine was that thing with the typewriter. I mean, she made some spelling mistakes, but still. Ooh, and you guys were all, "Barney, put out the cigar! It's a non-smoking room!" And I was all, "Hell, no, this is a Cuban!" Of course, eventually, I did put it out. Did I put it out? I put it out. Did I put it out? I put it out. Did I put it out? They’re in the car… It was a small fire, not even big enough to force an evacuation of the hotel, but definitely big enough to get us kicked out, and bring Marshall's bachelor party to an early end. Is that...? It is. They stop and Brad gets in the car naked… Hey, guys. How was the fight? Marshall, Ted and Barney are at the bar when Lily and Robin come in. Hey, what are you guys doing here? What happened to the bachelor party? We missed the fight, dinner was ruined, we spent half the night in the hospital, and got kicked out of the hotel. What do you think happened? Barney. Barney. Hey, I was just trying to be a good best man. You know what a best man does, Barney? He does what the groom wants. But all you ever think about is what you want, what's best for you. Best man? I'm not even sure I'm inviting you to the wedding at this point. You don't mean that. Why should I invite you? You don't even want us to get married. That's not true. Lily, don't. What? I'm sorry, Barney. It happened last summer when we were broken up. Flashback. Marshall, Ted and Barney are at the bar. Hey, what are you guys talking about? Lily. Ah, I got to go.  Newark Airport, please. San Francisco. Somebody knocks at Lily’s place. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Barney, what are you doing here? I can't believe it's really you. Come in, have a seat. Do you want some tea? I know the apartment's small, but I don't need much space. Let me show you some of my paintings. I think it's some of my best work ever. Just stop it. Lily, you have to come home. You and Marshall belong together. The two of you have something that most people search their whole lives for and never find. I know you love him, and if you knew what he was going through right now, you wouldn't be here for one more second. I bought you a ticket home. Marshall is one of the best people I know, and it won't be long until someone else realizes that, and you'll lose him forever. I can't stand the thought of that happening, and I cannot keep stealing chicks from him forever. Never, ever tell anyone I was here. I will deny it tooth and nail. This trip never happened. Hey, if you had three hours to kill before your flight, what would you do? Alcatraz or Fisherman's Wharf? You really did that? Marshall, I think Barney's your best man. Yeah. Yes, he is. See, Lily? This is why I didn't... Really? Really. Real... In your face, loser! Take it easy, all right. Ted's still my best man, too. You guys are co-best men. Right. Yes, we're both best man. No, um, seriously. You guys are co-best men. Of course. Flashback. Robin’s leaving the apartment at the the end of Lily’s party. I can't believe you got me this. Oh, I only did it as a joke. I can return it for you you want. Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have to go all the way back down there. I'll, I'll just throw it away. Well, I mean, if you were going to throw it away, maybe I'll take it in case I get Invited to another wedding shower. It's a great gag gift. Yeah, it's really funny. You know who would get a kick out of it? Marshall. So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it. I would be embarrassed if Marshall found out that I bought it for you, so I'd better just take it. Robin, leave it. Why does my stomach hurt? I'm sorry, baby. I ate a bunch of ice cream earlier today. Oh, baby, you know we're lactose-intolerant. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you suggesting that when one of you feels something, the other feels it, too? Oh, God, you guys are so codependent. No, we're not. Oh, really? What about the other day? Flashback. Lily and Marshall are in the kitchen. Oh, I need to get some eggs. Oh, I'll come with you. Marshall accompanies Lily up to the refrigerator. End of flashback. Just because we like spending time together doesn't mean we're codependent. Really? Then whatever happened to your plan of spending the last two weeks before your wedding sleeping apart? Okay, we decided not to do that because of... Logistics. Wedding logistics. Frickin' logistics, man. They mess everything up. You didn't do it because you couldn't do it. Sure we could. Then why don't you? You can stay with me. It would make our wedding night more special. Okay, let's do it. Done. I'm gonna go grab a beer. I'll come with you. No. I'll stay. CREDITS At the apartment, Lily’s on the phone. Robin and Ted come in… Okay, I know. You know? I got to go. Good-bye. My mom's driving me cra.... God, you guys are covered in sauce. We'll get to that. Me first. My mom is driving me crazy about the wedding music. The woman takes one cruise to Jamaica, and suddenly, it's "not a party without steel drums." Doesn't everybody know you're not supposed to stress out a bride right before her wedding?! Okay, sauce, go. Long story. I'll tell you later. Yeah. It's a dirty story, isn't it? You guys went out to dinner, did it in the kitchen and got caught. Scherbatsky reeks of someone who likes to get caught. Okay, now I have to wash up for two reasons. Oh, you didn't. That's right. So you and Lily really think you can spend two weeks apart? You know what, Barney? Lily and I are a lot less chees than you make us out to be. Marshmallow, don't forget to pack my night-night tape. Night-night tape? Did you make a tape of you saying "night-night" to her? No. He doesn't say it. He sings it. Oh, that is so sweet. Why don't you kiss? I love it when two chicks make out. Damn it. Nobody's bought us anything cool yet off our registry. What's on there? Ooh, lots of stuff. Kitchen Aide Artisan Series tilt-head stand mixer... Retail price $319.99. What else? Um, the Dyson DC17 Animal vacuum. Ah, $549.99. A little greedy, don't you think? Did you memorize our registry? No, I'm training. Training? For what? I'm glad you asked. Ted, Robin, get in here! You guys know how it's hard to be friends with me 'cause I'm so awesome? Yes, it's hard to be friends with you. Go on. Well, this isn't going to make it any easier. I am going to be on... The Price Is Right. No way! What?! Yes, in a couple days, Rich Fields is going to call out my name, and I will come on down. Whoa, that is so awesome. Barney, I didn't know you were such a fan of The Price is Right. Are you kidding? T.P.I.R. is not just an indescribably entertaining hour of television, it's a microcosm of our entire economic system-- a capitalist utopia, where consumers are rewarded for their persistence, market acumen and intrepid spirit. I gaze upon the glory of The Price Is Right, and I see the face of America. And it is divine. Plus, you know, hot chicks on sports cars. Then Lily headed out to Robin's for her first night away from Marshall. I'm ready! Lily comes into the livingroom with her wedding dress while Robin singins.) Ta-da-da-da-da... Wow, Lily, you look so beautiful. I know! I'm beautiful! I'm a fairy princess!  I'm too skinny for my dress! At Ted’s apartment… Meanwhile, I was testing out my best man toast on Marshall. Here goes. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Strong opening, right? That's fantastic. When Marshall graduates this spring, he'll be a lawyer. But did you know that Marshall has a criminal record? That's right, on a road trip up to Cape Cod, Marshall was pulled over for driving by himself in a car pool lane. Flashback. Marshall’s in the car and the siren oft he police rings… Oh, crap. Lily gets up… Oh, crap. End of flashback. Are you crazy? You cannot tell that story at my wedding. My entire family's gonna be there. My little cousins, my mom, my grandma, my grandpa the minister. That grandpa died three years ago. His favorite grandson is getting married, Ted. I think he can take a day off from haunting the barn to make an appearance. Barney comes into the apartment yelling, then he leaves again and yells diferently. So which one, "A" or "B"? What was that? I have to decide how to run to contestant's row when they say, "Barney Stinson, come on down!" Oh, I didn't realize that's what it was. Can you do them again? Yeah, of course. Barney leaves again, behind him Ted closes the door. Hey! Very funny. Just for that, when I win all the prizes, the only thing you guys are getting is Rice-A-Roni and Turtle Wax. At Robin’s apartment, Lily’s on the phone… It's $300 just to take the bust in? Oh, please, you have to have some sympathy for me. I'm getting married next Saturday, and I'm too skinny for my dress. I lost all this weight without even trying. Hello? What happened? She called me a bitch and hung up. Oh, I don't know what to do. I guess I'll just have to pay the $300. Pay the $300? Lily, are you crazy? This isn't a problem. It's a license to eat. Look, what have you always wanted to eat but didn't because it was too ridicuusly decadent? Ooh, a Valrhona chocolate soufflée with a raspberry brandy sauce topped with caramelized bananas and hazelnut gelato. I have Cool Whip and half a bag of Fritos. Done! At the apartment… Okay, think you're gonna be happy with my new toast. There's nothing sexual. It's, uh, it's just the story of an important moment in your relationship. I'm all ears. Hello, everyone, I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Nice. 00 in the morning, and I'm not gonna lie, we were a wee bit wasted. We were starving. So I'd gone out to get us some snacks, and when I got back... Flasback. In their college room, Lily and Marshall are sitting on the floor, when Ted comes in with the snacks, Lily doesn’t see him. I love you. I love you, too. I know it's soon to say it, but I'm so glad you did. Yeah. Ted leaves the room. End of flashback. Ted and Marshall are at the bar. drinking, having a girl in my room, eating junk food. Dude, you're almost 30. Your mom would be mad at you for eating junk food? Yeah, Ted, 'cause nutrition's not important. Also, so Lily's never heard that story before. How's she going to react when she finds out the first time I said "I love you" to her, I was actually saying it to you and a bag of Funyuns But who cares? You did love her. And you still do. And you're totally over Funyuns, so it's not weird. They join Robin and Lily at a table. Hey, Lil. Hey. Hey? That's it? What are you talking about? Well, you guys have been spending the last few nights apart. I figured there'd be a lot of giggling, crying, jumping up and down, and then whatever Lily would do Now, one thing I remember about the bar menu at McClaren's is that there were no fewer than 11 different deep-fried appetizers. That night, Aunt Lily ordered them all. Barney comes in with the wheel of a bike. Check it out. Okay, imagine... imagine, if you will, that this is the $1 space on The Price Is Right wheel. Ready? Oh, wow, that was pretty close. Close? Close?! It's called The Price Is Right, not The Price Is Close! Oh, man, this is bad. If I don't win the spin-off, and I can't get into the Showcase Showdown, everything's ruined! It's all ruined! What is ruined? Why, why is this such a big deal? Okay, guys... sit down, I've got to tell you something. The reason I'm going on The Price Is Right is because I've decided that it's time for me to meet my real father. Your father? That's right. My father... is Bob Barker. Your dad... is Bob Barker? That's right The host of The Price Is Right, Bob Barker? That's Pops. Barney? Yes, Robin? Why in the world do you think Bob Barker is your father? Uh, because my mother told me he was, that's why. Flashback. Barney’s a kid and he’s wathing the Price is Right. Mom, who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine? Oh, I don't know. That guy. Look, Dad, I got straight A's! Hey, Dad, guess who I'm going as for Halloween? Want to play some catch, Pop? End of flashback. So now I'm gonna go to L.A., be on the show, win the Showcase Showdown, make him proud of me, and then tell him who I am. You're gonna tell Bob Barker that you're his son on national television? Why is this so hard for you people to believe? Drop the popper! Lily has to gain five pounds in a week and a half, and it is my job to help her get there. This is the best wedding diet ever. At Robin’s… I lost a pound. That is impossible. You ate McDonald's every meal for three days. I knew that Super Size Me guy was full of it. Well, it must be the wedding stress. We just got to up the intake. Lily Aldrin, drop and give me 20 bites of fudge! Okay? Don't nibble at it. Attack it! Come on, Lily. You can do better than that! I can't. Well, eat faster, before your body figures out it's full. I'm trying. Oh, are you gonna cry? You gonna cry? Skinny little baby's gonna cry? Well, eat, damn it, eat! Okay! At the apartment… Hey, so I think I figured out how to do your toast in a completely appropriate way. Finally. Yeah. Good evening. I'm Ted Mosby, Marshall's best man. Still strong, right? Great, yeah. I'd like to share with you all a story about the momentous evening last fall Flashback. At the bar… Marshall and Lily kissing. 00 at night, doing shots of chocolate milk. Man, I'm well nourished right now! Calcium promotes healthy teeth and bones. Thanks, Marshall, for teaching us you don't need alcohol to have fun. Oh, don't thank me. Thank my parents for teaching me good values. Now, I wasn't supposed to hear this next part, but Marshall leaned over to Lily and whispered. You know what I'd like to do to you right now? I'd like to hold your hand. I'd like to hold your hand so hard that you're not able to shake hands for a week. Are you just going to talk about holding my hand or are you going to hold it? At the bathroom in the bar… Then a little later, Robin caught them... Oh, um... ...holding hands. End flashback. It was a lovely and responsible night. To Marshall and Lily. That's the worst toast I've ever heard, dude. It's totally boring. Exactly. It's impossible to write a good toast with you censoring me, man. I give up. I'm just going to read that thing about Jesus and the footprints. I give up, too. I don't care if my dress doesn't fit. I can't eat anymore. I-I feel like my stomach's going to explode. I know. 2 weeks later… And so, Lily and I were both about to give up, but as you can all see, Lily does look beautiful in that dress, and here I am giving a toast. You know, all this time, I'd been wracking my brain trying to pick out the perfect moment to capture Lily and Marshall as a couple. But then I realized the perfect moment wasn't some needle lost in the haystack of their ten years together. The perfect Lily and Marshall moment happened two nights ago. Flashback. At the apartment, Ted comes into the livingroom and Marshall comes homes. Marshall, what are you doing? Going to the bathroom. In the hall? Sleepwalking? You're wide awake. Robbing us? Dude. Turns out, all week long he'd been sneaking out to a hotel on 72nd, to meet Lily. Marshall and Lily are liying down on the bed of the hotel room. God, I missed you. I can't sleep without you. Hey, baby? Would you be the big spoon for a while? Sure, baby. How's the weight gaining going? Ugh, terribly. I'm too stressed out without you around. Well, I'm here now. And so Lily and Marshall failed in their experiment with apartness, but they succeeded in getting Lily into her dress. You know, there really are a million things I could tell you about Lily and Marshall, but really, the only thing you need to know is that ten years into their relationship, they still couldn't spend a single night apart. May they never have to again. To Lily and Marshall. To Lily and Marshall. Now, kids, the story of Lily and Marshall's wedding is a good one. No matter how perfectly you plan your... You know, wait a second, guys. I'll get to that. First, I've got to tell you what happened with Barney. They’re all at the apartment watching The Price Is Right… Rich, what is the name of our next participant? Bob, it's Barney Stinson! Come on down! You're the next contestant on The Price Is Right. Nooo. Oh, my God! Working his way out. High-five here, high-five there. A big old hug here. Oh, my God! Yeah, I know, the camera loves me. Welcome to contestant's row, Barney. Nice suit. Thanks, Da... Bob. Here is the next item up for bid! Bob, the stylish his-and-her watches feature an 18k gold bezel and crown and stainless steel bands. And Barney, what do you bid on that? Um... Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Retail price is $1,349.99, so, since you round off, I'll say $1,350, Bob. $1,350 for Barney. So, was it $1,350? I don't know. Was it? At the apartment, Lily  Oh, my God! Happy wedding. Barney, you won that camcorder in just one second! That is impressive. I mean impressive. Thank you, Bob. Now, to win the computer, you're going to have to bid again, and again I will say higher or lower. And let's show the audience the price of the computer, and audience, please, do not try to help us. And the clock will start with your first bid. $1 billion. Lower. So, I brought some photos that I thought you might like to see. This is me on my first birthday. Yes, Barney. This is... What are you doing? Uh, spending some quality time with my dad. That's very nice, but look, the clock is moving. You have only about 16 seconds. Keep bidding. No, no, I want you to see this. This is great. Keep bidding. Barney. This is me at my graduation. I know, the hair. That, no, that's nice. That's nice. You have only five, four, three, two, one... $999. Nine... Barney, you got it exactly right! Happy wedding again! Oh, my... I have to be honest, Bob. The big wheel is the only weak part of my game. I'm sure you'll do just fine, son. Did you just... I'm ready, Bob. Do it! Do it! Here we go! He's looking for the dollar. It's going around, and around... Oh, no, you spun it too hard. No, he didn't spin it hard enough. Here it comes, Barney. You got it! You won... But Barney... Barney, you're not through. You've won $1,000. You've won a place in the showcase. You are doing splendidly so far. Thank you, would you, would you say you're proud of me? Sure. That was kind of a weird moment. Very well, Barney, you have seen the first showcase. Do you want to bid on it or do you want to pass it to Millie? Please, no car and an above-ground spa? Pass. Millie, he has passed this showcase to you. What do you bid on it? $17,640. $17,640. Overbid! Now, let's see Showcase #2. Barney, your showcase begins with a mystery. Oh, I love this. I can't believe how excited I am right now Barney, you have seen your showcase. What do you bid on it? Please, please. Please. Let me. 1-8-4-2-1. I don't even know what we're going to do with a dune buggy, but I want it! And the actual retail price of your showcase is... $14,628. $14,628. Millie, you are over. Too bad. Barney, you bid $18,421 on your showcase. And the actual retail price of Barney's showcase is... $18,421 exactly right! You win both showcases, Barney.  Bob Barker, reminding you, help control the pet... Before, before we wrap up the show, there's just something I want to say to you…. Congratulations on 35 wonderful years hosting The Price Is Right. Well, thank you, Barney. Thank you... Have your pets spayed or neutered. Why didn't you tell him? Well, it's just... If you lived your whole life thinking one thing, it would be pretty devastating to find out that wasn't true. I just don't think Bob could have handled it. Bob. Yeah. Probably a good choice. Anyway, on the bright side. Happy wedding again! And that's the story of how Uncle Barney gave Lily and Marshall a dune buggy for their wedding. Marshall’s recording the good  night tape for Lily. Um, I thought since we're going to be apart for two whole weeks, I would sing you your night-night song. Night-night, Lily Night-night, Lily It's time to go to bed, oh, my silly, little Lily Time to rest your little head Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Come on, Ted. No, it's weird. You promised. Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Sha-la-la-la-la Lily and Robin enter in a house… Wow, it's beautiful, Lily. Yeah. It's just how I always pictured it. Well, that was a load of crap. You see, kids, when you get married, you learn a hard lesson. The wedding you set out to have is almost never the wedding you end up with. At the bar, 8 months before the wedding… So, we've decided on a small, outdoor wedding, just family and close friends. No more than 25 people in a beautiful garden somewhere, maybe an acoustic guitar playing while we walk down the aisle. And maybe you already know someone who went down to the courthouse and registered as an officiant so that he or she-- he-- could perform the ceremony. But you hate marriage. Why do you want to perform the ceremony? Because it subtly implants in the mind of every woman there that when I ask a question, you say, "I do." Yeah. The closer you get to the big day, the more concessions you make. At the apartment, 6 months before the wedding… Great. Now my mom's making me invite the Lessners. This puts our numbers in the triple digits. Wow. I guess sometimes, Lessner is more... ner. You know how like sometimes less is more. Yeah. This is one of those times, sweetie? You know what? That's okay. It'll be a slightly big outdoor wedding. At the bar, 5 months before the wedding… So it's not going to be an outdoor wedding anymore. Marshall's dad is convinced if we have an outdoor wedding in New York, he's going to get mugged, so it's going to be inside now. It'll be great. We're still going to have our acoustic guitar player. At the apartment, 3 months before the wedding… So now, instead of an acoustic guitar, we're having a harp player. Yeah. My dad owes a guy, and... that guy's daughter plays the harp. Is she hot? I'd love to be able to cross "harp player" off my list. How long is this list? Dude, I'm not gonna count how many pages the list is. I'm not crass. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. She's pregnant. Sweet! I can cross off two things. CREDITS And the day arrives for Lily and Marshall's very big indoor wedding... with a harp. 1 hour and 42 minutes before the wedding… Hi, Lily. Wow. Andrea. You really are pregnant. Yeah. How do you play the harp with your belly so...? Oh, I don't really-- I can only reach about half the strings. You only play half the harp? Yeah. Oh, no. Uh, okay. Lily, I will take care of this. Um, I'll just pluck the other half. Is it hard to learn? I've been studying the harp for 12 years. Yeah, but I'm a fast learner. You ever hear of "Guitar Hero"? Learned that in a day. Is there a "Harp Hero"? Robin, it's fine. So, so, when are you due? Tuesday. Wow, that's soon. Last Tuesday. 1 hour and 38 minutes before the wedding… Holy crap, we have to fire her. She's gonna drop a shorty in the middle of your ceremony. Robin, I'm not going to freak myself out. I hate those women who say, "Oh, my wedding has to be perfect." Things go wrong. Sometimes the deejay screws up your playlist. Sometimes you slip on placenta during the recessional. Barney arrives at the bar of the wedding… Can I grab a scotch and soda real quick? No. I'm not allowed to serve anything until the reception. Wow. You just cost yourself a big tip, buddy. I'm not allowed to accept tips, buddy. You allowed to accept criticism? You, sir, are an ass... buddy. In Lily’s room… Hey, you want to know what line doesn't work on a harp player? "Hey, baby, want to pluck?" Really? That didn't work. Not even a little. Hey! Who's Bill? Bill? Yeah. This guy came up to me at the bar. Flashback. Can I ask you something? Where in the ceremony is the place where they ask if anyone objects? Uh... Don't think they do that anymore. Oh, so when do you think someone should do it? Just wait for a lull or what? End of flasback. Oh, no. Did he look like a guy who tried to be an umpire but failed? He kind of did. That's Scooter. Your high school boyfriend, Scooter? His real name is Bill. My mom must have invited him. Why? Why would she do that? Our families are really close.  But my ex-boyfriend? Come on, Mom. I didn't invite that professional squash player Dad busted you with. Oh, I need a glass of wine. I'll get it. Oh, thanks. Hey, how's Marshall doing? He's great. He's about to get his hair cut. Oh. I'm worried my cousin's going to cut it too short. Me, too. I was up all night. Barney leaves the room when Scooter comes in… Hello, Lily. Hey, Bill. Hey, Barney. Scooter, what are you doing here? It's not "Scooter" anymore. It's Bill. A lot of things have changed about me, Lily, but one hasn't. I still love you. And I came here to win you back. You're really cute. Oh, no. Really? Scooter. Lily, I-I know it's crazy, but I love you, and if you can look me in the eye and tell me that you want to marry Marshall, I will leave right now and be out of your life forever. I want... I want... Scooter! Barney’s back a the bar… I need a glass of wine. And I need you to get out of my face. It's for the bride, so... BarmanWhite or red? White. And, uh... she'd also like a scotch and soda. You got it. She'd also like a bowl of smoked almonds. I don't have any, but I guess I could run out to the corner and get some. Well, it's only the biggest day of her life, so...The barman leaves… Let the games begin. 47 minutes before the wedding… Here. Can't stay. Got to try something. Maybe my words won't change your mind, but maybe the words of a poet will. I read from "November Rain." By W. Axl Rose. That is a good song. Barney said you needed me to bounce some guy named Scooter? Scooter runs out… What's up with Bill? That's Scooter. I'm on it. People start to sit in the wedding place… Hey. Hey. Can I have your phone number? No. It's for the bride. Oh. Hold on. Let me go get a pen. The bride wants you to walk slower. 40 minutes before the wedding, in Lily’s wearing her dress… Oh, wow. Oh. Robin... My makeup looks perfect right now, and I'm about to cry. Do something. I have hairy nipples. Really? No, but it worked, didn't it? Hey. Funny story. I tackled this guy I thought was Scooter. Turns out it was your photographer. Don't worry. I got this sweet camera phone, so we're covered. There's a photographer? Oh, my God. Okay, I just have to call... Robin, stop. Stop. It's okay. I am not gonna let anything get to me today. 33 minutes before the wedding… I just got a call from the florist. The flowers won't be here till halfway through the ceremony. I'm okay. 28 minutes before the wedding… I hate to bother you, but... I think I found your veil in the parking lot. I'm fine. 24 minutes before the wedding… my water broke. But I can probably... ...make it through. Totally cool. Oh, no. Lily, I think I forgot your bridal panties. I-I thought I had them. I'm so sorry. Oh, it's okay, I'll just wear the ones I have on. Are you sure? I'm marrying Marshall today. So it doesn't even matter that I'm gonna walk down the aisle without a veil in a room that has no flowers to the music of half a harp played by a woman who's crowning, as my high school boyfriend reads Guns N' Roses lyrics. But that's okay, because there's no photographer there to take any pictures of it anyway. Lily, are you okay? What do you think?! Of course I'm not okay! Everything that could possibly go wrong at my wedding has! It's ruined! What happened to "I don't want a perfect wedding"? Oh, grow up, Robin! Of course I want a perfect wedding! Oh, God. I wanted... I wanted not to care about the wedding, but... I do. I... I'm supposed to feel like a princess today. And you will. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. Why don't we go outside? I have something that'll make you feel better. What could you have that could possibly make me feel better? God, I hope Marshall's having a better day than I'm having. Marshall enters in a room with something to hide his hair… Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! What? Marshall shows his hair and he has blond drills. Well, it's not too short. My hair! Look at my hair! She ruined my hair! I look like one of the Backstreet Boys! You totally do. And not even the good Backstreet Boys, the older, lame dance move, comeback tour Backstreet Boys. The good Backstreet Boys? Guys! Guys! What am I gonna do?! What-what the hell happened to you? Lily's cousin is in beauty school, and Lily didn't want her to do her hair, so she said she could do mine. Flashback. Marshall’s with Lily’s cousin… So, um, just not-not too short, okay? Oh, no, we don't even have to cut it at all. Could just give it some style. Oh, okay, yeah, that's great. 'Cause, um, when it gets too short, it starts to look weird. And I don't want to look weird when I'm up there, you know. Ooh, I could give you some cool guy tips. I don't think I need advice on how to be cool, but yeah, great, lay that on me. End of flashback. I can't get married like this! There's no way! Ah, let me see what I can do. What? What can you do? I have a superpower. Lily is gonna kill me! Look at me! She's not gonna want to marry me like this. That's crazy. Of course she will. Would you marry me? never marry anyone you've had a farting contest with. Oh, great. So now you're saying Lily and I shouldn't even get married? In the wedding room… Could I have everyone's attention, please? It's for the bride. One, the bride would... like all of this tension out of my shoulders. And she would like, let's say, you in the inappropriatel short dress to rub them. Two... What was two? In Marshall’s room… Okay, we have a bit of a situation. Let's not panic. Let's just find a solution. Marshall takes a razor and shaves the middle of his hair… Dude, you shaved your freakin' head. Yeah, yeah, but it's good. I ought to shave it all off. What a great solution. Just be bald 'cause it's cool, right? Bruce Willis, Michael Jordan, Britney Spears... Oh, God, what did I do?! How could you let me shave my head?! What?! You're the worst best man ever! I hate you! I'm not going out there! I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.I'm gonna go find that money under the rock by the tree and go live with the guys on the beach in Zihautanejo. Dude, those guys are criminals. Only Red Andy was falsely accused. Ted, you're my best man! You got to do something! Okay, all right, come here. Just breathe, breathe, all right? Don't worry. Don't worry. I'll just... I'll take these. No! Ted’s in the wedding room… Uh, hi. Uncle Ben, right? Yes. Yes, we're, we're having a little bit of a problem back there. Um, and I was wondering if you could help us out. Yeah. Marshall accidentally shaved part of his head. Oh, no! Yeah. Yeah, so here's what I was thinking. What if I found something to cover up the bald area? Yeah, that would probably work, but with what? That's a tough one. Maybe a wig of some sort or a, um... toupee. Something that matches his hair color, which is, which is kind of the same color as the top of your hair. Mm, yeah. Does anyone here wear a toupee?  Shouldn't be hard to find out. Most of them are pretty bad. That is true. That is true. We just need to find someone who wears a toupee that is the same color as Marshall's and your hair. Boy, that's a pretty tall order. Really? You can't think of any place in the general area where there might be a toupee of the kind I'm describing to you? No, not off the top of my... No. Can't. Let me come at this from a different angle. I got $50 in my pocket which is probably a lot more... Barney comes and takes the toupee. The bride needs this. 13 minutes before the wedding, Marshall’s wearing the toupee. Actually, I think it kinda works. It totally does. Barney? To be honest, I'm, uh, I'm jealous I don't get to wear it. Okay, problem solved. Crisis averted. Let's get me married. It looks terrible, doesn't it? It kinda looks like fur, which gives you the appearance of a cleaned-up Bigfoot. Oh, you know... In a bad way. Hey. Cool hair, bro. What happened to your shirt? I got sauce on it when I tackled the caterer. You gonna put another shirt on? No, I'm good. Hey, you guys seen Scooter? What? What? Scooter's here? That guy's at my wedding? Not for long, bro. Not for long. Okay, you know what? I need some air. I think we should go for a walk, okay? In the park… It would cover up the problem. It's festive and it celebrates the heritage of this great nation. Okay, unless you actually have one in your car, stop suggesting authentic Native American headdress. Oh, no. Oh, my God! Marshall... Lily, you're not supposed to see me. Holy crap, I don't think anyone's supposed to see you. What happened? Did Amy do this to you? Just the frosted tips. I did the rest. I'm sorry, baby. I've ruined the whole wedding, haven't I? Oh, no, you didn't ruin the wedding, sweetie. It was already ruined. There's no flowers, no photographer. Oh, and Scooter's here, by the way. Yeah, I know. I heard. My veil got thrashed, the harp player is in labor, and I'm not wearing my wedding underwear. What? No "Property of Marshall" across the back? How are people going to know whose butt that is? What happened? Remember the wedding we wanted, the intimate outdoor ceremony? I wish we could have that wedding. So do it. What? Get married now. Right here. Look, it's outside like you always wanted. Intimate, close friends. There's no guitar, but it's pretty close. Barney can officiate. your jaws-- because Barney Stinson is about to aid and abet a marriage. Could we even do that? I mean, what about all those people in there? Do that one, too. And then when everything goes wrong, you won't care because you already had the real wedding out here. What do you think, baby? I love it. Me, too. Let's do it. Let's get married before we get married. Great. Wait, hold on. Excuse me, sir. Could we borrow your hat? Okay. Thank you. Lily takes the hat and gives it to Marshall. Hat. We thought of authentic Native American headdress before we thought of hat. Thank you all for coming. For those of you who don't know me... I'm not the biggest believer in marriage. But... you two are so great together, you know? It's like you were, uh, made for each other. He's gonna cry. No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not. Lily and Marshall... when everyone sees you, they... see true love. It's the best love... Can we just, um, move on to the rings or something? Oh, no. I don't have my vows. I don't have mine either. You don't need your vows. Just say why you love each other. Okay, I'll go first. Lily, there are a million reasons why I love you. You make me laugh and you take care of me when I'm sick. You're sweet, caring and you even created an egg dish and named it after me. She puts a little Italian dressing in scrambled eggs before she cooks them. It's called "Eggs Marshall," and it's awesome. But the main reason that I love you is that you're my best friend, Lily. You're, uh... you're the best friend I ever had. I'm sorry, buddy. No problem. It's totally okay. My turn. Oh, thank you. Marshall, I love you because you're funny and you make me feel loved and you make me feel safe and for our anniversary you gave me a sweatshirt that says, "Lily and Marshall. Rockin' It Since '96." I kinda wish I was wearing it right now 'cause it smells like you. But the main reason I love you, Marshall Ericksen, is you make me happy. You make me happy all the time. Hey, I found your panties! I'm good. Marshall, do you take Lily to be your wife to have and to hold from this day forward? Slow down. I can't From this day forward so as long as you both shall live? I do. Lily, do you promise to take Marshall to be your husband to have and to hold... live? I do. Okay, then, by the power invested in me by the very bitter old Pakistani man who works down at the courthouse on Lafayette Street, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. They kiss Did you smoke? No. Wow. First lie of marriage. That was fast. After that, we all went back inside for the second wedding. And yes, a lot of things did go wrong, but it didn't matter because when I look back on that day, what I remember is the first wedding; the intimate outdoor ceremony with just close friends and an acoustic guitar. In a room… How do you feel? Tired. I got married twice today. So where do you want to do it for the first time as a married couple, nice hotel room or a reception hall bathroom? What do you think? Bathroom, of course. In the bathroom… Please don't. Sorry, Ted. Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name? You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way yeah, a little. You know what we should do? We should come up with a whole new last name. Oh, that's easy-- Lily and Marshall Skywalker. Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff. I got it. You ready? You ready? Yeah. Lily and Marshall Awesome. Have you met the Awesomes? Marshall, Lily, their son, Totally and their daughter, Freakin'? I love you, Mr. Awesome. I love you, Mrs. Awesome. They kiss… Robin and Ted dancing… So... So... Wedding's over. Yes, it is. I guess starting tomorrow, we can tell people. Tell people what? Hi, Barney. Tell people what? The food looks delicious, doesn't it? Tell people what? Nothing. Oh, okay. Tell people what? Can we talk about this later? Absolutely. Tell people what? Hi. Have you met Barney? Hey. Barney Stinson. Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too. It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right. You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what? Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney? Okay. Whoo, that was a close one. Think he'll actually let it go? Barney  There's a black Nissan Stanza in the parking lot with it's lights on. Tell people what? Tell people what? CREDITS Ted and Robin are at the bar of the wedding… Can I get a water please? Tell people what? Oh, God! Okay. Look, we have some... news. But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day. So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon. Fine. It's pretty big, though. Oh, my God, just tell me! Oh, help us. What's wrong? We're starving. We planned this amazing meal with the caterers, and we haven't had a bite of it. Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked. We haven't eaten all day. All right, let's run some interference. Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on. Oh, there you are. My dear, you look so beautiful. Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to... And you... you look like a 1940s movie star. And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly. All right, let's get these two back to their table. We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we? The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier. Flashback. At Ted’s apartment. Conga line. Oh, yes, definitely. How about a slide show of you guys through the years set to Green Day's "Time of Your Life" and ending with your baby photos side by side. Oh, that's great. Going on the list. What list? Horrible wedding clichées we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole. Oh, like First Corinthians? That Bible verse? They do that at every wedding. How's it go? "Love is patient and kind. "Love does not envy or boast. "It is not arrogant or rude. "Love does not insist on it's own way. "It is not irritable or resentful. "Love bears all things, "believes all things, "hopes all things... "endures all things." Lame. Going on the list. End of flashack. Back to the wedding. We've done it. A wedding with zero clichées. Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clichée? Well, okay, one clichée. Well, technically two. No! They cleared our plates again! Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go? It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you. Well, you still have me. Yeah... Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something, so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great. No, Barney, this is my wedding, and I will sit wherever I damn well... Are those mini quiches?  Tell the secret. Okay, uh... it was our anniversary, so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's, which is where we went on our first date. Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin? Oh, right, that was you. I knew that was somebody I knew. What? Dude, you were there. That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives. Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on. Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over... Flashback. At the restaurant… Champagne? Um, we didn't order champagne. Compliments of the house. Wow. Thanks. Cheers. And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is... End of flashback. At the wedding… Mini quiche. You're a mega-douche. Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen, because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain. Oh, no, I gave it away. So what was in the glass? Right. So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom. He says, "Champagne?" "We didn't order any champagne." "Compliments of the house." "Wow." You said that already! Flashback. At the restaurant… Right. So Robin looks down, and there at the bottom of her glass... Is an engagement ring. End of Flashback. Anything you want to say to the bride and groom? Don't get married. Why don't I come back. An engagement ring?No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no! That's what she said. Flashback. No. No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me. No. No, no, no. What are you talking about? This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here. That's not mine. What? That's not mine. Then whose is it? It's mine. Janna... will you marry me? Yes. Wow. That was hilarious. I was like... what? Anyway. What the hell was that? What the hell was what? That reaction? I thought you were proposing to me. Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire. Ted, you know how I feel about marriage. Now more than ever. I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight? No. Then why is this an issue? Because even though you don't want to get married, I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year, and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction than, "No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Ted, you cannot do this to me. "No. No, no, no." Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out. I don't know why. I'm sorry. Can we please just let it go? No. End of flashback. Hey, Stinson. Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain. So did you guys find anything to eat? I had four strawberries. Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries? Yes. Lily, you could have burped or said the word "Yes," but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you. Oh, look, more strawberries! So what happened next? Flashback. Ted, don't do this. No, seriously. Where do you see yourself in five years? Where do you see yourself? Honestly, in five years... I probably want to be married. And I probably want to be in Argentina. Argentina? Or Tokyo, or Paris. Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years. And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure. We have an expiration date, don't we? End of flashback. Oh, my God. You guys broke up. You guys broke up. I can't believe it. Barney... story's not over. Flashback. Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home? Yeah, of course. Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually... Oh, my God, it's you. Wha... what? You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn. Run! End of flashback. Run? Your strategy was run? It was a perfectly good idea. They didn't have our credit card information. They didn't know us from Adam. I stand by it. Yeah? And how did that work out for you? Ted and Robin run and knock down the traw that the waiter was holding, at Robin’s apartment… I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license till we bring the horn back. Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them? Flashback, at the restaurant… Look, I'm sorry about the French horn. I want to make this right. So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run! Ted runs and fall. End of flashback.. So... Argentina. Argentina. Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina? Mmm, American schools suck at geography. What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina? You don't want to live there. I could want to live in Argentina. No, you couldn't. I mean, you life is here and your career. I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere, and I hope it does. Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too. They have buildings in Argentina. And Paris. And even Tokyo. I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents. So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina? Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad. I just finished a big project at work. I got some money saved up. If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now. Let's move to Argentina. Oh, shut up. You're scared I might not be kidding. Aren't you? Nope. Your move, Scherbatsky. Okay. Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina. End of flashback… No es posible! Nobody moves to Argentina. The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years, the government is opposed to free market reforms, and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos. I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium. Man, she was chatty. Right? Right? You caught the bouquet? Barney. The story's not over yet. Flashback. Ted and Robin are in Robin’s apartment kissing. Wait, wait, wait, wait. What? I don't know if I can do this to you. Do what? Well, you say you want to move to Argentina, but you want to have kids. Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there. On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black "X" over Argentina. You know what I mean. No, I don't. Okay, say we had kids. They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere. They would grow up on the road having adventures with us. Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect. Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan. But if I was going to have someone's babies, I'd have your babies. Enf of flashback That's when you run. Tell me you ran, Ted. Flashback. Ted and Robin are kissing on the couch. Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second. Do you have a...? Ted. No, I don't. Well, we probably shouldn't. Yeah. Risk it? Risk it. End of flashback. No. All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around, Lily and Marshall are going to cut the cake. No. Robin, you're not... No, say the story's not over. Come on, they're cutting the cake. Say the story's not over! Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant. Okay, Lily. I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay? Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clichée, remember? No, it's going to be so funny. Lily. Lily, just feed me the cake. Please, baby, I am so hungry. Whoopsy-daisy. And she's okay. She's all right. That was funny. And it's time for the honeymoon. Guys, guys, guys. Thank you so much. We love you. I love you. The man who was with the camera comes back near Barney… Getting married, having kids. It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake. God, this guy's giving me nothing. All right, have fun in Scotland. If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, "What's up?" Nessie's a she, Ted, come on. Marshall and Lily leave. Hey, kiddo. BarneyYou are going to miss out on a lot of awesome stuff. You'll be at home with the kid while I am out awesome-ing all over the place. And you're going to get fat. The story's not over, Barney. Flashback Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro. Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out. Not a euphemism. Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave. Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh. Solidarity, sister. That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up. Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here, but we didn't, so... Yeah. We were all talk, weren't we? We're not doing this, are we? I don't want to have kids in Argentina. And I don't want to have kids in Argentina. So where does that leave us? Well... we could stay together and... pretend this stuff doesn't matter. Or... we could give back the blue French horn. You stole a blue French horn for me. I would have stolen you a whole orchestra. End of flashback. You did break up. Yep. You're not pregnant? Nope. An-And Marshall and Lily don't know? Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys, but Lily was pretty stressed out, so... We decided not to say anything till after the wedding. You guys okay? Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but... But we're okay. The open bar helps. Excuse me, Miss. Hi. Could I have this dance? Well, we knew this day would come eventually. Take care of her, little man. Marshall and Lily are in a limo… This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you. Uh, driver. Hello! Ranjit !! Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel? You do not have to stop. You can be together as man and wife right back there, and because we are friends... I will not watch. Um, no, we actually had something else in mind. Okay. In a fast food.. Lily, go sit down. Welcome to Wienerburger. Hi. Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles? And a number four with no onions. Let me guess. Jefferson High prom? No. But thank you. Actually, we just got married. Wow. Congratulations. Thank you. That's $7.80. Hey, dude. Yeah. I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash. My wife… So Marshall and Lily were married, and Robin and I were broken up. And as hard as it was at the time, in the end we both got what we wanted. She did eventually go on to live in Argentina and Morocco and Greece, Russia, even Japan for a little while. And I... well, I met your mom. I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself about what you want out of life,  Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda and a cigar. Ted meets Barney in the terrace. I'm really sorry about you and Robin. I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up, but you were really good together. Yeah... we were. She just wasn't the one, you know? The one. Oh, Ted, no. Do not tell me you're going to start searching for "the one" again. The only time I want to hear you saying "the one" is if it's followed by the word "hundredth." What up? No, I need a break from all that, I... I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know? Really? 'Cause... you know, you've been in a relationship for a year. You're going to... be a little rusty. Yeah. I'm just saying... you're gonna need, need, need some help out there. Could be. Ted? Yes, Barney. Do you think... Do you think maybe you might... need a wingman again? I do. Yes! Yes! We're back. We are back. And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend... Wait for it… Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother.  You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here. The Year 2007] ...Dary ! Legendary ! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready. When will you be ready ? It was a good question. I grew my breakup beard. Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale. I'm not ready. I repainted the apartment. Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah. I'm not ready. And the truth is, I was doing really good. Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get "Cirque de So-Laid". What up ? Barney, come on, we've covered this. Robin ! Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael. Hola. Okay, I'm ready. I just can't believe her.  We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy ? You know what she's doing ? She's trying to win the breakup. What do you mean "Win the breakup", old timey inventor. What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers. It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world , that was a competition. That's my wife. Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name ? Gael. I'm sorry, Gayle ? Gael. Kyle ? Gael. Girl ? It's pronounced "guy-el". It's means "joyful". That is why I live my life by bringing joy, good energy and happiness to others. Especially those less fortunate that I. I'm sorry. So it's Gayle ? What a jerk ? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent. That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner. And, oh, he is a masseuse. With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your heartbeat. One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it. Career ? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time. How ? How would one do that exactly ? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me. Not possible. You cannot have sex on a windsurfing board. How do you know ? Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have sex. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had sex in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule. To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian. This conversation never happened. All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing. Yes ! You guys, have fun of your duble date. Oh, for the hundredth time, I'm sorry, there was a lull. And then we fell asleep on the beach while counting the stars. Do you want to have diner with me ? Uh, us ? There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot. No, I don't ! ...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy. Well, you did. I'm one of the lucky few. Male Gayle is not hot. He's not our friend. Don't even look at him. Just... no eye contact. So that night, as Lily and Marshall did their best to hate Gael... Hey, Robin.  Gael. ...Robin pulled me aside to check in. Now, I'm sure, she meant the best, but she said the worst. I just want to make sure you're okay with this. "I just want to make sure you're okay with this" ? Damn it ! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she ? Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah. Amy. Ted. Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style ! I'm sorry this is all so weird. Weird ? Why would it be weird ? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot ? I do not ! Shut up ! Oh, my God ! I just hope Ted's okay. Hmm. I hate to see you so tense.  I mean, we had a really clean break up, you know ? We really acted like adults, so the last thing... Oh ! Oh, God, oh ! Gael, are you properly licensed massage therapist ? What ? Are you legally certified by some type of gouverning entity ? I train for three years at an institute in Buenos Aires. I have a card. I can show you. Is the card laminated ? What do you mean "laminated" ? Covered in protective plastic. Oh, yes. Damn it !  He checks out... Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. What ?!! Let's bail, this place is dead. Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out. Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up ? Are you blind ? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning. Yeah. But I didn't get to help. So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her ? Apology accepted. Let's go. Who's the suit ? Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy. I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep. 54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. Beat it, nerd. Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again ! Massage therapist. And you know what, "Gayle" ? Your piece of chicken looks a little tense to me. Oh, oh, does that feel good, Mr. Chicken ? Well, guess what ? I didn't wash my hands. Got him. Lily ?! We carry so much ancient emotion in our neck and shoulders. Things we should have let go of years ago. Oh, I forgive you, Mom. Lily, we are Ted's best friends. Our job is to hate that guy. Oh, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was building him up so few minutes later, I could totally cut him down. Weren't you wearing a bra ? The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks...  sort of. They know us here ! You're gonna get us in trouble. Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina ? You... your vagina... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving. Good idea. Let's all go back to my place. Your place ? Thanks, but no thanks, 1994 Courtney Love. I have a hot tub. Okay, this place is actually pretty nice. I like your tatts. Thanks. You can play with them if you want. They're a hundred percent real. No, your tatts... toos. Your tattoos. Oh, thanks. You should get one. Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn. Yeah ? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink. No, he wouldn't. Yes, he would. No, he wouldn't. Yuh-huh. Nuh-uh. I'm ready to do anything you want by the way. Anything. Right now. Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing ? I think I'd look way hot with some ink. Yeah, you would. Yeah. Oh my God, Tyler ? Mommy ! Daddy ! She's back. Damn it ! They're supposed to be in the Hamptons. Run ! Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair. Unfair ? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted ? Ted, you okay ? Robin and Gael are windsurfing) Hello, Ted. Robin and I are about to make fantastic aquatic sex on this windsurfing board. And I just want to make sure you're okay with this.  Okay, how do we do this ? I think your leg goes up, up... Okay, how 'bout if I, um... No, mine... I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo. You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path. That dark path is my driveway. But you need a plan and you need a wingman ! This is so going in my blog ! Want to have sex ? Okay. And underneath, it should say "I win". And then it should have flames coming out the bottom. Oh, fire. We should start a fire. After this maybe. Oh, man, this is going to be legen... wait for it... And that's all I remember. Hey, buddy, how was your night ? You know, it was great. I met this crazy girl, I almost got a tattoo. Don’t worry, I didn’t. But it was... It was amazing. I think it’s safe to say, I am winning this breakup. Look. Oh my God ! What ? Nothing. This J. Crew catalog. Who brings two golden retrievers in a canoe ? We've gotta call Barney. Way ahead of you. I am never speaking to Ted again. Hum. Really, never ? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass ? What ? Hum. Ted ? Could you grab me the fondue pot ? And up we go. Thank you. Hum. Hum. What ? Ted ? Hmm ? I came here this morning because... I want to apologize. Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter. See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now. Hmm. Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon ? I was always bad at science. He's gonna say it. A butterfly ?  What ? Nothing, buddy. Ow. Why did that hurt so... ? Oh my God !  I have a tattoo. Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp. Tramp stamp ? You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate. And suddenly it all came back to me. Tattoo parlor] ...Dary. Legendary ! Man, I am so winning this breakup. Mm, I just broke up with my boyfriend Steve. He was totally annoying. He was like, “I think you’re the one, I want to marry you.” What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends ? Yeah. Sure, I mean, we’re still friends, right Steve ? Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend’s name is Steve. What are the odds of that... ? Wait. No no no no no no no. Give me this. Oh, yeah, that'll get it out. Maybe you should try club soda. Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this ? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil ? What happened here last night ? Last night got weird. The Apartment] Feel the emotions release. Think I just got over being chunky in the ninth grade. You're beautiful. I am beautiful. Experience your food. Try the mango. Okay, that’s enough of the fruit. We're sorry, Ted. It'll never happen again. It meant nothing to us. It just felt really really really good. I can’t even look at you two right now. Ted. He got a tramp stamp. All right, first of all, this isn't one of those, "I came all the way over here because I want you back" things. There’ll be no startling confession of love, no sweet indie rock song that swells up just as we’re about to kiss, none of that crap. Got it ? Okay. Good. Now, here’s the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We’re broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what ? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that’s just wrong. So I’m gonna yell irrationally for a while and you’re just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay ? If you feel like you need to do that, then... I think I do ! I really think I do ! So now, I’m yelling ! You shaved. I did. I like the beard. Okay, I’m done. I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I’m sorry. Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know ? I-I’m still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie. Over it ? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that’s why Gael happened. You weren’t trying to win the break-up ? I was trying to survive it. Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we’ll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot ? The guy’s an Adonis. He’s not an Adonis. He’s the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy’s perfect. He’s not perfect. Oh, come on. He’s hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I’m better than that guy. "You’re bigger". Don’t patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller. No, Ted... "you’re bigger". I win ! Kids, I can’t remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I’m sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before.  It’s funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me. Go for Barney. Hey, man. It’s Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something. What is it ? Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com. 57…and counting) What does this mean ? Marshall ? Ma... ? No.  No ! So, beeing married, different ? Not different ? It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up. I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore. No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly. Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes... Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders ? It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly. It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location. Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round. Thanks. I am such a jerk. Yeah. Wait, why ? I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes. Marshall brownies. Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine. That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen. Yes ! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter. No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy... Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what ? It didn't work. So, there. You guys are jerks ! So, after Robin and I broke up, she needed some time away. Away from her normal home, her normal life, and it turns out, her normal self. I was just so uptight in New York, you know ? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before. Here. Eat. If we run out of fish I will catch more with my hands. A drum circle ! They're different every time. Let's go watch ! And here I am at the drum circle. Whoa. Are you topless ? Ted, check this out. Seen 'em. Wow. It seems like a great trip. Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know. Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here. You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, gun-toting new yorker. Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look. What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted. I'm just happy Robin's happy. Thank you. Man, this is like "Where's Waldo" of exposed genitalia. Except that it's really easy to find Waldo. I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina. Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a "Best if banged by" sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being "Unevolved Robin", the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted. I'm just happy Robin's happy. I'm telling you, within three days... Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words. Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association. My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses. What are we talking of ? Baseball ? This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted. I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant. That night, Marshall, sit down, to write the letter he hoped Lily would never have to read. "My dearest, sweetest, Lily pad. Let this letter be a small beacon, a tiny firefly to help light your way trough the years ahead. My love for you persists, higher than the Himalayas, deeper than a scottish loch. a-3-9-3-2. Cancel Vogue. L." My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... "Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother."  And that's all I remember until the hospital. That guy... Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it. Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why ? He's better looking than us. No. Because he's from out of town. Mmm. Barney; With an accent and an innoncent smile, you don't even have to try. Yeah. Plus automatic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists. Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit ? Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning. Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on ? Actually, it's on its own island. Oh. Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted. Hi, um, I'm Colleen. Hi, Colleen. This is Lindsay. Hi, Lindsay. So, hey, you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. What do you say... ah, never mind. No... No, what is it ? Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around. Yeah. Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon ? Atfer lunch ? Well. Hotdog ! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub ? It's kind of a lame bar, but sure. Really ? It doesn't seem that lame to me. It's pretty lame. I think it's cool. We'll see you tomorrow. All right. I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there. Okay. All right. So, Gael, huh ? Mmm. Still going strong ? Yeah. It's great. Amazing, fantastic, awesome. Ooh, that's one too many. What's going on ? Well, now that I'm home, I'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that I loved on vacation. Here, taste. Experience your food. Oh, so good. Here taste. Experience your food. Ooh sofa ! Ooh sofa ! Sofa, sofa, oh... ooh Ooh. We're alone, now. I must have you. Ooh. I must have you. Laptop ! Laptop ! Laptop ! And you know what else ? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from ? Well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip. But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what ? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow. Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me ? Don't mind if I do, love. Gael, there's some weird du..  Hello. Hey. Good news. I made some travelling friends today, and they'll be staying with us. How do you say... indefinetly ?! G'day. Oh, here. Will you sign this thank you note ? Wow. Both sides. You wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box. Wow, it's a really nice blender. Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it. I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong ? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong ? Except that when you die, I'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were "Cancel Vogue". How can you open my letter ? That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme. Marshall, wait.  This was our first fight as a married couple. Oh, baby. Oh. Kids, when you visited New York, there are count of something funny to see and do. And yes Colleen and Linsay took us to Tater-Skinz. This is our favorite restaurant in the city. Yes, I'm sure this is the best of their 57 "spudtacular" east coast locations. I'm going to run to the restroom. I'm gonna go, too. This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next ? A knock, knock joke. Easiest ? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time. Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude. I'm looking at you. What ? Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o ? All right, Ignatius, one more hour. Nice.  Nice. Hey, nice. Hey. Our friends invited us to a party. You guys want to come along ? Knock, knock. Who's there ? Yes, we do. Look at my hand, how weird is my hand ?" is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I...  And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked. Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR ? We should have taken the Hudson. Where are we even going anyway ? 148th and Brook Avenue. A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night ? We're going to get killed. Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands. There were three of them, at least two guns... they took all our money. Well. I only had traveler's checks. Hey, babe. I've been thinking about our fight. Yes ? I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet. Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead. You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter ? Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter. Really ? Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again. Lily, I won't, I promise. Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder. Do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too ? I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff ? You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids ? Come on. Let's get out of here. This night's a disaster. What ?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means. "Thank God, we're alive" sex. "Thank God we're alive" sex. It's even better than "I can't believe you just proposed to me" sex, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close. All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life. Whew. Wow. I think we all need to go back to our place and recover. Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know ? Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live ? What ? West village ? Close. West Orange. West Orange ? New Jersey ? Yeah. You guys live in New Jersey, not New York ? Theodore. Yep. New Jersey ? Teddy ? Yeah. But don't worry, it's pretty much New York. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. New Jersey is not "pretty much New York". You are not "pretty much new yorkers". And how would you know ? Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that ?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to "pretty much New York" ? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey ! You're not from Missouri ? Well, I will be a monkey's unc... Ew.  Can we get a ride ? Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too ? Newark, born and raised. Can you please keep it down ? What happened to you, man ? You said you wouldn't change, but look at you. No more tan, no more beaded braids, no more lush, untamed forest of leg and armpit hair. You're back at work. What gives ? Well. I have to have a job. "I have to have a job", God, that's so american. I'm canadian. You know that. What about the important things like making your own jewerly and lying on the beach and thinking about peace ? God, don't you care about thinking about peace ? Wow. I just realized something. That you've lost your way. No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from ? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up. Don't you remember Argentina ? Don't you want to go back ? What are you doing ? Shh. Let this happen. All right, everyone out ! I said everyone out ! All right, we're living, we're leaving, okay. Michael Moore was so right about americans. I'm canadian ! Robin, are you okay ? No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something. After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin. Welcome home, Scherbatsky. Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night. Listening. This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like. Okay, I'm done... but I really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. Can you swear to me you won't open it ? Totally. What does it say ? Marshall, I'm serious. Okay. I promise I won't, I won't open that until you're dead. Okay. And through 22 wonderful years of marriage, Marshall kept his promise. The Year 2029] Until November 1 of last year when, sadly... "Busted ! I knew you'd read this. You suck, Marshall, you totally suck." That's it ? I suck. Lily. Yes, you suck. You said you wouldn't read it and you did. Well, you didn't keep your promise either. I don't see any dirty pictures in here. Oh, fine, I'll take the dirty pictures. I don't want 'em now. What is that supposed to mean ? What ?! Nothing. Nothing. You're beautiful. I would love the photos. Have I told you how beautiful you look ? INT. LIVING ROOM Kids, I know you think that you've heard every story from back before I met your mother. But there are some stories you tell and some stories you don't. INT. MEN'S RESTROOM Oh my God. Barney...oh my God. Use your words, Ted. OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt. The belt? The belt. But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago. Yes, advantage Ericksen. Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight. Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass. All right, I'm ready, let's hit it. Can't go. Tournament. What? We agreed, I suited up. You take too long to get ready What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look. Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve. And then he starts on his hair. Ace. Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not? Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes. Really? Yes. All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes. 3 beers, 5 minutes. Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from? Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy. I saw it first. You just made the list, bitch. So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots? You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress? Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've begun a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave. FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough. Shekwakie. Stinson. All right, the beers are here. Yeah, we're not gonna make it. Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off? Yeah, pants are off. This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio. Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer. Ted. Trudy. Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since... I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape? That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted ... that night. These are not all for me. No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed. You were embarrassed? I was like, I really like this guy and now I'm climbing out his window. And I forgot my underwear. Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding. I am so glad I ran into you. I know, do you wanna get a ... Trudy, no way! Oh my God, Rachel, how are you? Ted, this is Rachel. Hi. Kappa Epsilon Gamma! Whoo! Let me guess, you guys met in prison. No, we're sorority sisters. And best friends forever, all sophomore year. When we weren't at each other's throats. We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now. Hey, mista... ... hey mista, stay away from my sista. We have so much catching up do to. OK, are you going to Stacy's wedding? Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes. No! Again? That's like her third one. I know. Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly. So, Trudy and I got a table. Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired. But I want you to stay. Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake. OK, guys, be cool. OPENING CREDITS INT. APARTMENT Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean. That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set. Stinson. I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident. You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape. Respect. So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive. I think the new girl's kinda into me. So you now have two on the line? And I don't know which one to go for. Go for the new girl. Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove. New girl? What new girl? Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think... Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me. Are they friends? Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters. Are they Betas? Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway. They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both. OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out. I thought we were in for the evening. That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor. INT. MACLAREN'S Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up? Well, that's very complicated. See, he agrees with me. You're such a little man-thief. You're the man-thief, man-thief. Oh, somebody should lock you girls up. You're so funny. I think Ted is funny. Really? I think Ted is hilarious. I am never not wearing a suit again. Hello. It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom. Hi Mom, how's dad's colon? What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick. They are? Are you sure? Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light. Are you positive? INT. RESTAURANT That is so fascinating. So what happened? Well, after eighteen hours of surgery, I closed and thankfully both girls just celebrated their second birthday. Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling. True, but now the parents don't know what to do with their huge supply of four-legged overalls. That is so funny. You are so funny. INT. MACLAREN'S Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby. Oh, it's Robin. Good luck. Bye mom. My mom. Hello. Bring me a razor. What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions? They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome. No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving... Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent. I'm on my way. So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him? Neither of us. He left, junior year abroad. It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do. We were gonna do, but never did. What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did. No, It's too embarrassing. You tell him. No, you tell him. I don't care if you don't care. I don't care. Nobody cares, just say it. Why don't we tell him together? OK, on three. One. Well, he's right, it's a dead heat. Two. Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel. Three INT. MEN'S RESTROOM It's a tricycle. No way, no way, no way! What's happening? It's a tricycle. No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle. Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts. Put him on speaker. So what you're saying to us right now is you have a shot at the belt? Wait wait wait, what belt? Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt. Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right? Behold. You actually bought a belt. That's right, it's resplendent. It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around. I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well... Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt. If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle. If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your penis. Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do? All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83? Yes. Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds. Yes. Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women? What? No. Ted? No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues. (Ted hangs up_ INT. MACLAREN'S Oh, are you guys leaving? Well, it is getting pretty late. Right, well... I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before. Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs. I'm sorry, where was your apartment again? That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs. INT. APARTMENT Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, "Please, don't, I love my dead wife," but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life. Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle. I already did this morning. Hello. Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs. Sorry, I can't leave now. Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian INT. RESTAURANT There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor? No, but fifty will. INT. APARTMENT Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars. We're combing upsars? What does that mean? He's coming upstairs! Where are my pants? Where's my pants! Got 'em. Ooh, nice place! Hey, are these your roommates? Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music. You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music. That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom. OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble. Of course we can't promise anything. This is gonna be awesome. No! What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got... We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top. Yeah bro, up top. Oh, don't be gross. You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape. No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted. Oh, you can use our bedroom. OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney. What are you doing? I cannot allow Ted to do this. Why, why? Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom. But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting. I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close. So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location? Oh my God. My new carpet. Oh my God, this is a disaster, You get the carpet cleaner, I'll get a towel. OK. I'll get the video camera. Get out! OK then. Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're... Tom Petty. Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty. Where's Lily? Still looking for that CD, so... What are you doing? I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right. I saw it first. You just made the list, bitch. I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded. Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me. No, never. What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail? Thanks, enjoy our bedroom. OK, take it. Wish me luck. (Ted checks out his hair in the mirror, steps towards the door, steps back to mirror and touches up his hair again, steps towards the door, steps back to mirror and continues to touch up his hair Oh my God. INT. RESTAURANT Where's the shaving cream? Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream. Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream? Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date? Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude? Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch. Hey Robin, the valet's brought the car around. I thought we'd go back to my place. You in the mood for a night cap? Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front? Yeah. You've gotta be kidding me. Excuse me. INT. APARTMENT So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD. That's OK, we don't need music to have fun. Exactly. You do like to have fun, don't you Ted? It's getting late, I'll get your coats. INT. TED'S BEDROOM I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on. Ted, you're ruining this for everyone. Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors shoot themselves in the foot. If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night. So, Barney, why don't we take this party to a more horizontal location? Oh no, the night's ruined! No, baby, it's not. Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat? Why would you do that to yourself? Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me. See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have? The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn. It won't? No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1. Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila. Oh! Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place. Right, that's my apartment. Dressing gown's mine too. Damn, this should be me. Anyway, continue. I am so exhausted. So exhausted. Why would I want to tire them out? That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one. You give the most amazing foot massage. It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother. Why in God's name would I say that? It's endearing, you're a caregiver. Never take family values out of the equation. Step three. Ted, what's wrong? I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano. OK, what the hell. OK, wait for it. Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy. Oh my God. That's so true. Yeah. Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this. Yes you can. I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys. All right. I'll see you on the other side. INT. APARTMENT INT. MACLAREN'S Doesn't seem right to talk about it. What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it. You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you? You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me! Some stories you tell, some stories you don't. Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you? Ted, belt. Did you? Did you? Or didn't you? Did? Tell me. You know if he did it? INT. RESTAURANT Oh hey. Will you go in there and see if my date's OK? No problem. No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open. Yeah. You know... Why don't I buy you a drink? OK. Did I overhear that you're a surgeon? Guilty as charged. You're so funny. I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again. It was Saturday night in New York City and the young metropolitan set was out on the town, living the kind of crazy lifestyle you can only find in the Big Apple. INT. APARTMENT 97, 98, 99, 100! 100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon. So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart. What's his 'but'? When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw. She's totally hot and really fun. But she has a dead tooth. She's superhot and she's so successful. But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller. She's so cute and she's so smart. But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing. Wow, set it up. I'm still convinced she killed my turtle. Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice. If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it! Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute. Fine, but he has a kid. Oh. Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid. But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class. Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids. I don't hate kids. You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids. Robin, will you watch cartoons with me? I go to school all week. Can't I just have five minutes to myself to read Highlights and drink my juice? OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them. Well, you don't wanna have them. I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vagina Shotgun. You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays. Nice. You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy. OK, that's awesome. Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but... But she's afraid of commitment. But she's a gun nut. But she's Canadian. But she didn't like Field of Dreams. I can't think of anything. You don't have a 'but'. OPENING CREDITS INT. MACLAREN'S OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch. Why? The ultimate ice breaker. A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please. So, what are the eye patches for? We got bit. Yes. Both of us. They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up! EXT. NEW YORK CITY So, Robin went on a date with George, the guy with the kid. And afterwards... INT. APARTMENT OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date. But? Great, I can't wait to meet him. Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid. Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later. I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad. Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting. Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time? A good one. He won full custody. He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it? Don't tell anyone I said that. INT. MACLAREN'S I'm going out, buying eye patches. What are you doing to help score chicks? OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches. Oh, Theodore... ...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game. Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen. Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner. Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn. Wow. Wow. You're here and not in stall two. Yeah, so? I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes. OK, Marshall. Yes. Which one of us has more game? Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me. If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game. Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league. You're joking. I have mad game, bra. OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert. I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant. What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out. Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list. Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines? First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day. Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl. Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad. Fine. There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges... Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins. That's good too. How about her? You're on. Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules? OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind. One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly. Just stop. You're bumming everybody out. Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars. I win. How? Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot. Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook. I can't sleep with her again. She hates me. Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time. Ted, she's leaving. Get out of my way. By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy. Look who's got game. INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT You're a big kids person, huh? Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet. Babies. Yeah, I like that kind. Well, Doug's almost six Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to...  I hate kids. I mean, I don't hate kids. I'm just not a kid person. I mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little, but beyond that, what's the draw? You must think I'm nuts. What? No no no. So you don't like kids, so what? I'm not looking for a mother for Doug. Why don't we just hold off on you meeting him? Yeah, let's take things slow. And, kids, that's exactly what she did. INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM Then on a totally different day that was definitely not the next morning, Aunt Robin had to face her worst fear. INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT INT. APARTMENT Hey, what's up? It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do? Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin. INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT I'm Robin. That's a bird's name. No it's not. It's actually a type of bird. My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code? Dude, I'm just reading my paper. Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal? Sure. What? No, you pour the cereal first so you know how much milk you need. It tastes better milk first. It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl. Why are you wearing my dad's pants? Milk first it is. The business section. The Fed's gonna lower rates again to bail out these subprime lenders, bunch of idiots. Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names. Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that. That's what I said. You're pretty cool. You too. Meanwhile, Stacy and I had started dating. Oh, Stacy was the girl from the bar. Anyway, I was close to winning the bet when something unexpected happened, I started to really like her. INT. MACLAREN'S Well, have fun in yoga. She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good. Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile. You see this. Game face. Whatever, Ted. Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that? Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song. I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have sex twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had sex a total of...wait for it... Nice. One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had sex and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered. Doesn't count. Totally counts. I still matter. OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know. Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing. No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak. No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on. Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK? Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic. Fine. And I only stirred that with my pinky. INT. APARTMENT Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool. Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me. Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him. What? Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached. What? I hate to tell you this but, too late. He drew it in class today. Oh crap. There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops. You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships. The second you get close to a guy, you wanna bail. OK, granted, he's six, but the point stands. We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me INT. MACLAREN'S That's totally you. You guys are totally crazy. Hey, who drew the picture of Robin? It's not me. You're joking, right? It's not me. "My new mommy." Kinda has a nice ring to it. Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs? Do guys really think this is me? Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too. Really? Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do. Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass. INT. STACY'S APARTMENT So, I, I had a really nice time tonight. Me too. Yeah? Mm-hm. Hey, Ted, pucker up all you want but I was here first. From this spot, I also launched an expedition to those two large ridges down there. Uh, Ted, something wrong? INT. GEORGE'S APARTMENT Hey, Doug. Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower. Actually, I came to see you. I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.? Sure, why not? To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies. Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme. Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this. Aunt Robin didn't know what to say. This kid had never been dumped before. But then she realized this kid had never been dumped before. She could use every cliché in the book. We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends. Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter. I had so much coffee earlier, I need to run to the loo. Hey Dougie. That was my new mommy. So, this picture is not of me? Why would I draw a picture of you? How many dates has she been on with your dad? Two. Well, I've been on like five and you like her better? We just really connected. And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town. Why are you getting so upset, Roberta? Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember? Whatever. So, that's it, huh? Look, you're great, but... Yeah, there's always a 'but'. INT. MACLAREN'S Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song. Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win. What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped. That's what you think happened. OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any... Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend? You are so sweet. So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him. So you never slept with her? Not even at all. Wow, that's good. It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation? Well., have fun in yoga Well? Oh. I'm sorry. Stacy, right? Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar? Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too? I do. She plays bass in a reggae band. I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae. Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band. No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan. I should go inside. After a while crocodile. See you later alligator. We are two peas. Wow, take care. Namaste. You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat. So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing. Why? Parce que je le jeu me chienne. 'cause I got game, bitches. No, no, this doesn't prove anything because... Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy. Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over. I should have just worn that stupid eye patch. INT. APARTMENT I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old. Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids. Of course, Robin eventually made her peace with kids. And as you guys know she went on to appear in some very important works of arts. Yours. INT. STACY'S APARTMENT Hey. You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow. Since Ted, you know, I don't really wanna get too physical too fast. That's what makes you so special, baby. Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy. Kids, back in the fall of 2007, I was dating this girl named...oh God, what was her name? It's been 23 years, I can't remember all this stuff. For the sake of the story, let's call her... Everyone, this is Blah-blah. Please call me Blah. So, Blah, how did you two meet? Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical. It was so magical. Except it wasn't. She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online. Ay, Chihuahua. What? There's no stigma anymore. Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore. So, she's hot. Oh, she's gorgeous. Then she's crazy. No she's not. Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes. OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me. There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale. She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot. Wait, hot-crazy scale? Let me illustrate. A girl is allowed to be crazy ... ... as long as she is equally hot. Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot. If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot. You want the girl to be above this line Vicky Mendoza diagonal ...then lose ten pounds. She'd stab me with a fork ... ... then get a boob job. I should give her a call. OPENING CREDITS INT. MACLAREN'S OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class. I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts... She's not crazy. OK, we'll see. Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted. It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy. You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now. All right, but spoiler alert, it ends with everyone saying 'aw.' Aw. Starts with it too. When you've been a couple as long as Marshall and Lily, telling the how we met story becomes a choreographed dance. It was late August 1996 Lily and I were both freshmen moving into Hewitt Hall. And she needed some help setting up her stereo. For some unknown reason, I felt drawn to room 110. As if she knew that someone very special was behind that door. And as fate would have it, that someone was Marshall. It was love at first sight. Hi. Hi. Ohhh. I know, right? Now, they perfected that story over hundreds of tellings. The first time Marshall told it to me, it was a little different. Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today,  wanna tap that. You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did. Saw 'aw.' Aw. I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys. Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks. Shut up. So, we know how Marshall and Lily met. Robin, how did you and Barney meet? No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No. Really? Sixteen no's. Really? So, you're single. Yeah. Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great. You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college. Uncle Marshall was doing something that lots of college kids do. How do I say this? He was, uh, let's say eating a sandwich. Dude, I heard the dean is coming. Put out your sandwich. Hey. Sir? Please, just call me Ted. OK, Dean Ted. Whoa. Someone's been eating a sandwich. What? No. Really? I don't know 'cause I don't even know what sandwiches smell like. My parents are gonna donate a lot of money to this school. So you're bottom bunk, that's cool. I wanted the top bunk anyway. What do you mean? This is so unfair. I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night. You're not the dean. College, good times. Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap. Oh, here we go. Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags. Your own line of handbags? That's crazy. These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan? Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if ... Where can I get one? I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted? Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted. Wow, that just came out of nowhere. No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about. I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be? No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be. Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable. You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please. OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it. Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died. Oh, I'm sorry about that. No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh. Oh man, I'm really sorry. Wow, you bought that? I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name? Ted. Are you a total idiot, Ted? Well played. I like you Ted. Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Barney. We met at the urinal. Oh right, hi. Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit. I'm not wearing a suit. Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A. Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes. Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward. Edward, this is Audrey. You know, I actually know some sign language. Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like. I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too. What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time. My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number. Here. Call me. And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever. Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently. He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number. Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online. Oh my God, you told them. OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies. Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right? Wait, you guys dated. For how long? A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about sex, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online? Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name. Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that. Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale. She started the night here But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone. Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to kill me with a brick. I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin. Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now. I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that. Their story is not as magical as it seems. What do you mean? No, I can't, it's kind of a secret. Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight. The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party. Hey, you a freshwoman? I never use the word freshman. Sexist. Yeah, I'm a first-year. I'm in Hewitt 220. No way, Hewitt 110. You should totally come by. Maybe I will, Hewitt 110. Chug chug chug chug These drunk idiots. Hey, don't drink their two dollar beer. This is a pinot noir from Europe. Oh, it's fruity. Yeah, I cut it with some cranberry juice, it's pretty strong. So, uh, do you have a girlfriend? Yeah. Not sure about the whole long distance thing though. It's like Descartes says, "In order to determine whether we can know anything with certainty, we first have to doubt everything we know." You know? Wow. As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me. Oh my God. Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK? You have to tell Marshall. If he heard that, it would destroy him. If you don't tell him, I will. Oh, come on, you wouldn't. Oh no. So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story. I don't think anyone wants to hear that story. Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago. I made a huge mistake last night, but it's like Descartes says. In order to determine whether there's anything we can know with certain, we first have to doubt everything we know. And I now know for certain that I love you, Karen. Anyway, call me back when you get this. I'm also going down to the computer center to send you an electronic mail. Ted, this is Lily. No, no, I'm sorry but I love Karen. Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round? That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em. Tell us what? Lily, will you help us get the next round? Ted, what's going on? She knows about us, about how we really met. Yeah, I know, I just told her. No, the real story. Ted, what are you talking about? Lily, come on. Come on what? Lily, come on. Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about. Lily, come on. I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall. What? Ted and I never made out. Yeah, we did. I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy. What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl. That wasn't me. Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party. No, no no no no no no no no no no no. Yeah, like five or six times. It was right over there. Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you. I'm sorry, who are you again? This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass. I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed. You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da. No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference. So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying? I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend. Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her. Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily. You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange. Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger. Poor guy's gonna crash and burn. That man is a god. For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once. I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing. Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private? Yeah, of course, what's wrong? You know that guy I made out with at the freshman orientation party? Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah. And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party? Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah. I'm too-much-tongue guy. And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl. Worst superheroes ever. Baby, I am so sorry. I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily. Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley. If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man. You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily. I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa. Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me. World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online? We should grab some coffee sometime... Yes, we should. What's your name? Ted. What's yours? Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game. So, suffice it to say, Blah-blah did not turn out to be your mother. As for the girl I made out with at the party... ...there wasn't a doubt in my mind, that was your Aunt Lily. But you know that magical story of how she and Uncle Marshall met, it was worth preserving, so I kept my mouth shut. I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa. EXT. BUILDING INT. COLLEGE REUNION Until our 20th college reunion when I ran into Alexa Leskies. So, Ted, remember the last time we were here? You and me? No idea. Ted, come on. Freshman year, we were both pretty drunk? That was you? Lily, we never made out. I know. So I am not too-much-tongue guy. Actually. No. Look what I've confiscated from some kids. That is a fat sandwich. I know, right? Chew chew chew chew, swallow. It's all right, honey. Sandwiches are strong these days. I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done. Baby, can we grow sandwiches behind the garage? Dude, we're 42. Where's my wife? You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna call her. Right now. I'm gonna do the whole, "Hey! you remember me? It's been so long!" See, it's funny because I just saw her. Dude you can't call her. You have to wait three days to call a woman. That's the rule Barney, that rule is completely played out. Girls know exactly what you're doing. Hey! I gotta new rule. It's kinda crazy, but I call it, "You like her, you call her." I'm sorry can you repeat that? I don't speak "I-never-get-laid." Barney, the three days rule is insane. I mean, who even came up with that? Jesus. Barney, don't do this. Not with Jesus. Jesus started the whole wait three days thing. He waited three days to come back to life. It was perfect. If he'd had waited one day a lot of people wouldn't have even heard that he died! They would be all, "<a annotation-fragment="1636589" class="referent" classification="accepted" data-id="1636589" href="/How-i-met-your-mother-the-three-days-rule-annotated#note-1636589" image="false" ng-class="{ Hey Jesus Whadup!" and <a annotation-fragment="1634399" class="referent" classification="accepted" data-id="1634399" href="/How-i-met-your-mother-the-three-days-rule-annotated#note-1634399" image="false" ng-class="{ Jesus would probably be like "Whadup?, I and then they'd be all, "Uh, you look pretty alive to me dude," and then <a annotation-fragment="1634429" class="referent" classification="accepted" data-id="1634429" href="/How-i-met-your-mother-the-three-days-rule-annotated#note-1634429" image="false" ng-class="{ Jesus would have to explain how he was resurrected, and <a annotation-fragment="1634412" class="referent" classification="accepted" data-id="1634412" href="/How-i-met-your-mother-the-three-days-rule-annotated#note-1634412" image="false" ng-class="{ how it was a miracle and then the dude would be like, <a annotation-fragment="1634423" class="referent" classification="accepted" data-id="1634423" href="/How-i-met-your-mother-the-three-days-rule-annotated#note-1634423" image="false" ng-class="{ "Uh okay, whatever you say bro."

Kids, on my first day as a college professor, there were two things I didn't know that I wish did. The first thing was that your mother was in that classroom. The second thing? Well, to explain that we have to go back to the beginning of the summer, when, after a year of wrestling with their feelings for each other, Barney and Robin finally, well Volume. Use your indoor "whoo. " Sorry. It's jt they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! I love this! Lily, listen. Barney's awesome. Robin's more than just awe-"some. " She's awe-"quite a bit. " She's awe-"a whole darn lot. " Wait, what are you saying? We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends. Is it something I did? God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us. It's us. You understand, right? Sure, of course. As long as you're happy, I'm happy. We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips. I know. So has the boat sailed on sex tonight or After that, the summer went by way too fast. Until all of a sudden, it was the Friday before my first day as a college professor. What's this? It's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favorite professor of all time. A fedora. I'm Indiana Jones! That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy. You know what we should do? We should Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff. God you just get me. I got a date. What! I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night, and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds. You got first whip! All right. Hey, dummy. What did tell you about smoking in here? Make him whip the habit! I'so excited about this whip! I got whip fever! Just whip him, Ted! Don't even aim! Just whip him! - I'm so sorry. There's such a thing as common sense, you know. How I Met Your Mother par la "Have You Met Team" So, how long has this been going on? All summer. I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend. Girlfriend? Slow your roll there, Lilypad. You've been together all summer. I dot get it. It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk. We should figure out what this is. Yes, we should. Or. Or Okay, now, we have to figure this out. Yes, we do. Or. Or We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk. Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, "I don't know. It's not that I don't like you. "It's just that I haven't had a girlfriend in a really long time. I hope it doesn't make you mad. " - Who needs it? - You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other. We knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret. Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on. You need tdefine the relationship. You ne to have the talk. Or. Or I know what you're all thinking. "Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class?" I know the board says "Professor Mosby," but to you I'm Ted. Question. Awesome. Hit it. Here's my question, "Ted," who the hell do you think you are? We're supposed to learn from you? You failed as an architect. And if you're a professor, where's your hat and your whip? - They're at home. I - And where are your pants? Oh, God. It was awful. I was teaching Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms? I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this. Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed. Mistake N3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back. I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend. Exactly. If people don't know their place, nobody's happy. Amen. Define the relationship. Yes! No! Lily, private convo time. Can't you just let us be happy? You're notappy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy. You and Robin need to have the talk. Why? Give me one good reason. Headlights. Deer. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Look, Brad's here. I've got two tickets to the Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was tnking What do I have to do? Put a gun to your head? - Buy you a six pack? - Come on, Brad, that's There's really six of them. No, no boyfriend. Great! It's a date. I just thought of a reason. The next night, Robin and Brad went to a hockey game. You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night. Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on! Not really. The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you. Oh, man. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious. No, Brad, no, it's But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different. God, no Brad, no - This is about me and Barney. I mean, my heart says "leap into it. " My brain says "it's a bad idea. " Sounds like you guys need to have the talk. We're not gonna have the talk! Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have sex afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted. Because Robin is already his girlfriend. What?! MacLaren's Bar, four years ago How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. i. e. Don't ever see them during the day. And rule number 3, never feed them after midnight. Meaning she doesn't sleep over and you don't have breakfast with her ever. What about brunch? Is brunch cool? No, Ted. Brunch is not cool. New topic. How do I pick a tie? Simple. Remember in the movie Predator I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend? Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night. Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam! Okay, how about this? If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney. Why not? Lay it on me. Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce! It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend. Girlfriend? - Hey, come on. A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend. A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay? Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk? Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls I'll punch a baby. I don't care. Finally, my first class had arrived. For real this time. I knew I had to make a strong impression. I had thought of everything. Except Wait. Does professor have one "F" or two? Oh, my God Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. Professor. I don't know. Just do something! Two "F's". That looks right. I think that's right. Hey, sorry I went little too far last night. We've been over this. Unless I say "flugelhorn" you haven't gone too far. No, I meant punching Brad. Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this? Flugelhorn. Did you do this? - Ted, are you out there? - Ted's not here, Robin. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk. Lily! Come on. Let us out! No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go. You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having sex! Well, guess what? I brought Marshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same. Hey, guys. I still hadn't decided what kind of professor I wanted to be authoritative or cool guy. I thought I would decide in the moment. And I did. About 20 times. Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg. Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here. Okay, good luck. Byesies. This was it, my crossroads moment. What kind of professor was I gonna be I had to decide. Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now Professor Mosby had arrived. Of course, if I had taken that girl's question who, by the way, was not your mom. Your mom was sitting Wait, let me finish this real quick. Here's what that girl would have said. I'm sorry to bother you, Professor Mosby, but this isn't Architecture 101. This is Economics 305. You're in the wrong classroom. Yes, I was in the wrong classroom. And thus began the most humiliating seven minutes of my life. Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room is already an architect. Architect? "We're just hanging out. " Just hanging out? Not good enough. Not good enough! Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about? Economics? Don't laugh. He's not He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A. "We're seeing where things are going. " I'll tell you where things aren't doing out of that bedroom. Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice No questions! "We're Barnman and Robin. " Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily. Not good enough. Not good enough! So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an archite, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now. Wait Don't all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack! Sorry I'm late, everyone. My name is Professor Calzonetti. This is Economics 305. You may return to your seats. Sorry, sir. This is Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right? Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7. Buddy, I'm sure and their professor all got the room wrong. T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro. Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. They still haven't had the talk? I think I know how to speed things up Not cool! Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy. Dude, I'm starving. Let's Let's just have the stupid talk. But how do these things even work? What do we say? Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy. But Where do you see this relationship going? I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend for a long time. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a clich�, but he really ruined me for other men. Of course, I wasn't in the room for this conversation, but I have to imagine Robin said something like that. Maybe we should go back to being just friends. Maybe. But I don't want to stop having sex. Good. Me, neither. Friends isn't gonna work. We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at? - I know something we're good at. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade Not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying? Really? Really. We sat down. We had the talk. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say. We're both afraid of commitment but the fact is, we also can't live without each other. And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause she's awesome. And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit. She can handle her Scotch. He's my boyfriend. And she's my girlfriend. Good enough! She bought it. Hook, line, and sinker. We are good. Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast? You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good. Well, lead the way, sweetie pie. You do realize they were lying, right? They don't realize they weren't lying. Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello. What? Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night? Doesn't feel very good, does it? par la "Have You Met Team" This is the story of two blind date. One in 2009 and one seven years earlier. In all that time, my dating routine remained more or less the same Until the fall of 2009, when I finally had a date that was different. Because it was exactly the same. I was on a blind date with the same woman I went on a blind date with seven years earlier. It's nice to meet you. And she didn't remember it. But then again It's nice to meet you, too. Neither did I. How I Met Your Mother par la "Have You Met Team" pour Guess who just got four tickets to the "Origins of Chewbacca" Star Wars exhibit? - Why? - No, I said, "Guess who?". I heard you. Isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship? What are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there? Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me? Do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? Even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful. We're not going to the "Origins of Chewbacca" exhibit. It's in Houston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls. Where are you taking me, Barney? This wasn't the first time your Uncle Barney had kidnapped one of us. Wait a second. The "Origins of Chewbacca" exhibit's in Montreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me? My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But wee still stopping for chili dogs first. Stop the cab. Where are you taking me? Barney, why are we here? Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the se time. 30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead, it's lime. Meanwhile, Jen and I were in my favorite first date restaurant. for the second time. Jen, what do you do? I'm between jobs banking crisis. I'm between jobs Internet bubble burst. Makes me realize I should go into something more stable like banking. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that is Manhattan's skyline. I teach architecture. Get 50% off the book store, so that's pretty sweet. Married! What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women. I do! - It's just not that easy. I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile. Not everyone is you, okay? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that It seems so much like cheating on Lily that I feel guilty So first, I need to have a different fantasy. Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medically legitimate. What?! How could this be?! Beats me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have. It's time, baby. I will never love again. No, Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from than one time. And plow her like a cornfield. And so, Marshall to honor Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield. Delivery for Marshall Eriksen. This once for you Lily. Where do I sign? And then watch out, because it is on! At is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies. It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help. I accept your invitation. From this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind. Gentlemen, say hello to J Jasmine. Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like? Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily! Yeah, I can't talk right now. I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined! Stop looking at her. Look, I got to go. Take a picture. I will. But first, I'm going make Marshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant - between his wife's tatas. Good. 'Cause if you didn't that would be mighty shellfish. That's bad. That's why it's funny! We've been on this date before. We've been on this exact blind date before. In this exact same restaurant. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well. Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby. Wait, you You dress your cats up in weird costumes. They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people in New York, only to end up back here, with each other. We're going to die alone, aren't we? Well, you've got your cats. This is insane. Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby? We were sitting over there Main Lobster. They spelled "Maine" without the "e. " Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by I get it. Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty. I had no idea. What about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across? That's right the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance. Guys want to wave the girl off and, you know, look like a big shot. I had no idea. This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. Cause let's be honest we are scaring people off, Jen. We really are. I'm in. I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I? And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group. Tone down the kitty talk. Check. You will not believe who we saw tonight. We saw the third doppelganger! I should explain. Over the years we had spotted two strangers who looked exactly like members of our group. Lesbian Robin. And moustache Marshall. By the folwing summer, we would find the remaining two doppelgangers. But I'll get to that. Ladies meet stripper Lily. Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you. So you went to a strip club? Busted. And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me? - Before you get married, let me - Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. I bet them wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that. Strip club. Marshall made me go. So what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn. I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket. It's a little brisk out tonight, huh? - Not really. I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that. I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about. After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his 68 Camaro. That or bare-knuckle boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps. I had an aunt in the Coast Guard. So no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener? Why didn't you lead off with that? Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas. We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies - are totally cool with it. Because they understand that it's healthy - for us to do that from time to time. Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here. No, we're not. Sometimes I think about other women. It happens, but even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you passing away first, because even in a fantasy world I could never cheat on you. You're you're just my life, baby. And I love you. You kill me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not murder me?! Murder?! No! I, baby, no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even st up a foundation at your name. We're, like, this close to a cure. Remember? I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them. Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly "can't think"of anything I do wrong. Did he juggle? Bad puns? Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check? Let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy. Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player. We were all sitting over there And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze What about Cat Woman? That would've been good. Nice. Wait I remember that. I was not checking out a girl. Nice. We were checking out Moustache Marshall. Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry. It's nice to know "past me" wasn't a total jackass, huh? "Present you" isn't so bad, either. I remember this. And there's the Chrysler Building. And the Empire State Building. 00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass. That's kind of sweet. Snack break. Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. I know this wasn't the best first date of all time, but I'm glad we stuck it out. Me, too. That was really great. What went wrong? I remember now. So would you maybe want to go out again? I would. Will you call me? Absolutely. I have been so busy. Good night, Ted. Jen, I'm sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again. There are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't, and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now you're both. You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or, you know, killing me off. I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and sex. It's gotten to the point where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial. We got to fix this. When Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty. Thanks, baby. I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you. Bring out Stripper Lily! You know, I don't come here that much. Here's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching. Thank you, kindly stranger. Ladies and gentlemen I didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for Jasmine. I am hot! Crawl for it, stripper me. It is awesome, baby, can I get another hundred? - That was a hundred? - She crawls fast. I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like Johnny Depp. He has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight. The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight. No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently who knows what would have happened? You are the best. You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me - and she couldn't care less. We're dating now. That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this. If you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in the Champagne room. Just the best. Now what? I just remembered why I didn't call you. Why? I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but I like finding typos in menus. And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth is I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes. Now that you mention it I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day. Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now? Dear God, I hope that don't happen. Good luck out there, Jen. You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady. And kids, when I told your mother that shellfish joke, she did laugh. And I swear, it was only, like, 30% pity. Looks like Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots. What did you say, buddy? Who? I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping? Jerk! Bastard! Barack Obama Jr. ?! Mm-hmm. And yes we can. But there's one name none of us ever expected to hear him called. Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say. Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. But other than that, things are good? Bowl. Bowl. I don't know. I think Barney's been single for too long. Bowl. 00 a. m. Barney, are you awake? Barney? Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed. Bowl. That's happened three times. Bowl. And it's not just that, it's other things. Hey. What's wrong?  I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff. Oh, thanks. And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have sex. Mm-kay? Bowl. Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est person in the world, but a little more effort would be nice. Bowl. Bowl. I understand. Bowl. I guess, in a lot of ways, Barney doesn't stack up. Bowl. Bowl. I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. No, that's not it. Bowl. I don't know. Maybe he just doesn't have it in him. Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake. Bowl? She really said that? And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present. Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me-- Mm-hmm. I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out! But then a funny thing happened. Over the next couple weeks, Barney was thoughtful, considerate sweet. In short, the perfect boyfriend. Which, to Robin, meant only one thing. He's cheating on me. What?! Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side. Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would Go on. Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago. Well, that doesn't prove anything. Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. And what do you plan on doing with it? We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere. No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. friend, confidant, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target. But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch. Let go. Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner. There's a basement storage area? Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found. Oh, that's great, honey. What the hell is that? Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years. Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin Barrel resin? Just go with it. So you need a hand throwing it out? No, I'm not I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family. So, um, what are you going to do with Mabel? I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone? Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess. Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle. "The Bermuda Triangle" was the name we'd given years earlier to the curb right in front of our building. Whenever we wanted to give something away, we'd put it right there. It was uncanny. This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just just the best barrel. Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here. Be cool, baby. Damn! See you, sweetie. Good luck. Bye, babe. Now, can we please get out of here? Yeah. I'll grab my coat. Oops. A college notebook?! Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb. July 23. the Vancouver Canucks. 29, but tells people that she's 26. " Oh, my God, these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me. I hope I'm not too late! I want to see the look of joy on the new owner's face! She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight? What do you know about this, Marshall? Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me? Well The truth was Barney was taking a night school class taught by me. Welcome to Robin 101. Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago. rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out! Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about? Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her. Okay. And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times. Hey, guys. What you talking about? Fantasy football. Fantasy football. They realized they couldn't talk about this stuff at the bar, and since you live with Ted, they had to find someplace safe. So Ted's classroom. "How To Date Robin Scherbatsky. " Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down I'm bored. You said you wanted my help. Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard? We did that ready. No, like, really big boobs. No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me. Can we have class outside? No! What Robin really wants deep down  Barney! What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah-- "H's" or no? Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you? They said I had A-D something. Can we have class outside? Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?

Neither can you, sweetie. Well, he doesn't know that, baby! God! Ted's only teaching Barney horrible things about me. I don't know. Check this out. This is actually kind of sweet. Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call "touchy-feely. " She doesn't say, "I love you," like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, "You're an idiot. " "You're an idiot"? Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say "I love you," she's already broken up with you in her mind. I think 's nice that Ted knows you that well.

Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English. On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises. Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?  You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me? Hey! He is an expert. Kiss ass. You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong. Uh, really? Name one wrong thing. "Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones"? Let me clear something up for you, Ted. Does lefty like that? Oh. Yeah Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'. Noted. That was a lie? We had just started dating. I was being nice. And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence. That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on. You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying. What do you want? Look. All that stuff I told Barney It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry. I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered. It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know? Well, since you know me pretty well am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing? I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work Very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve. Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook. But there's there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women-- blondes, brunettes, redheads; big boobs, small boobs, medium boobs; some boobs that were big, but kind of in a bad way. The point is-- boobs that pointed in opposite direc-- I'm really scared that you're going to dump me and that's why I did this and I'm sorry. You're an idiot. You know Hmm? That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address. Hmm. And your work address. Whoa. Hey, guys! If you don't want the barrel, can you sit somewhere else? You're scaring away potential takers. Designed by Chicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind Uh, Professor Mosby? Yes, Susan? That's a woman drinking beer on the toilet. Right. That-That was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on. So I decided to change my look a little bit. And people were noticing. Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch. You know, I've always Wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches. Because the people who wear them are constantly going, "Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?" You are wrong. Get laid? The ladies dig the professor look. You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher Was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things. So guys, Marshall And I wanted to invite you to our place For a little couples' night. Uh, sure. Why not? For years, Marshall and Lily had been the only Married couple in a group full of single people. It got lonely. so they were always Searching for another couple To double-date. There was only one problem. Welcome. Gouda? They sucked at it. This is great. We're having fun. You're having fun, right? So, should we just go ahead And lock the four of us in for new year's? Um, it's April. Right. Sorry. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk Thanksgiving. Our parents really want to meet you! Well, we should probably be going. Wait. But, wait, if you leave now, Colonel mustard just gets away with it. It's getting pretty late. We're going to go. There's still pie. Tonight was fantastic. We should do it again. I'm sorry, Marshall, but Falguni and I Are just not that into you. And you. But just when Lily and Marshall were about to give up, Two of their best friends in the world got together. And hope returned to their hearts. Wohoo! So when Lily said Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place For a little couples' night. Um, sure, why not? . Barney and Robin had no idea What they were about to walk into. Okay. Game time. Let's review the flow of the room. Barney and Robin enter here. Stop here for margaritas. That's a great conversation starter. We can tell them about our trip to Cabo. Great, 'cause I got that story about Sammy Hagar Anthe Belgian waffle locked and loaded. Then we'll move on to the hot apps station. And, depending on how things are going, Some lively pre-dinner charades. Right, but, uh, we'll play that one by Sounds like? Okay, you can be Robin's partner. Oh Baby, we can do this. Welcome. Gouda? Meanwhile, my half-baked theory That ladies dig the professor look Was actually proving to be true So is it hard to grade papers? No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a shot. I'm trashed right now, and I blame Our public school system. Sometimes things just seem to magically fall into place. So, you said you live right upstairs Whether it's in the dating world Take care. Bye. bye! Or the double-dating world. Nailed it! Best night ever! Worst night ever. Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily? Brutal. Really? How? It was like we were on a date With a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call. And they were so nervous, That they weren't even making sense half of the time. Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita? In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle! Come on in. And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces. Yeah, how'd you know? Poor Marshall. Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she lets Marshall Is pick out one sad block of cheese. That's prosciutto-wrapped melon. You guys are going to want to get in on this gouda. That's seared scallops with a mango chutney. Seriously, don't sleep on the gouda. And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil. Ooh Tick-tock goes the gouda clock. Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway. P. S. , not sitting great. And if anything didn't go according to plan, They would freak out. What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie? I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them. Now, Robin You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh, Marshall. Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad. Show him. This is a web site Marshall already made about last night. It's called itwasthebestnightever. com. oh, that's not good. That's the 17th. Friday or Sunday would also work. Or basically any other day. Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses. I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, Why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit? I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, But we had no idea how much. Oh. Yeah, tough luck, Every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water. Let's do it again, soon. Yeah, we'll call you. They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that? Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date. Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'lluh, call you. Right? Who was that? Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging The whole professor thing. Last night, She picked me up at the bar. And then Well, she actually Wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens. Uh, no, it doesn't. Sure, it does. You know, she was, She was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon. Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly? Westchester. Why?  You're the sexless innkeeper. Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper! What the hell is "the sexless innkeeper"? Ted, many a man-- nay, many a soul-- Has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it? Not really. T'was the night before new year's, And the weather grew mean. 00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens. The tavern grew empty, The gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in Wait. If this was last year, Why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist? Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, And my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left And stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard And weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings And swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream And threw up in my mouth. I asked, "where do you live?" And she said, "one block south. " I swallowed my pride And six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods That she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, She found a sound sleeper. And thus she became The sexless innkeeper. And so are you Wait, you're saying that girl Just used me for a place to crash? Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket which basically says You're not interested in, nor probably even capable of, having sex. And she thought, "hey, free lodging. " No way. I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention Of ever hooking up with you. Which is funny, because usually It's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!  Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails And texts we've sent you. We have. Go on. Because we went ahead and booked That couples' weekend for all of us in Vermont! Wait, you guys were serious about that? Oh, we never joke about b&amp;b's, Especially at the height of syrup season. Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, Antiquing, then a hated hay ride. 00 a. m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there. Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, But we respect you guys too much As friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth. The US Navy has found intelligent alien life At the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I Have been tapped to lead the expedition. Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls When you're too much of a coward to dump them. Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome. What's going on? Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, Let alone you guys. Plus, the alien thing. Come on, Marshall. Let's go. NoLily You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine. I think they bought it. I can't believe they broke up with us. We're so lovable. No, we're not. We're ugly and gross. I thought we did everything right. I know! I know. We had the gouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing. Oh, dear god. Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people. It was true. Marshall had become addicted to creating songs And photo montages documenting various mundane events. now everything's okay. it's gonna bring us all closer together. We'll miss you, whiskers. I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now. If I recall, they didn't dump us Until you brought up that Vermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, Then a trip to Vermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that. Oh, what about you forgetting To check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do, Marshall. One thing. One thing? One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door Sliced itself up, And arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle Around not three, not four But five different kinds Of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers? You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker! Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard. Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk? Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize. To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper, Do you do that cheapy thing Where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving? Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger. You're right. Thank you. All that sexlessness has made you wise. For god's sake! Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does. But eventually, Even Barney and Robin had to admit They owed Lily and Marshall an apology. Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry. Oh. I wish you had called. I swear, he was right there Just eating a Belgian waffle!  Well, he can't have enjoyed it As much as I'm enjoying this gouda! Oh! Um, listen, Now's not a good time. We'll call you. Wai. t We just want Hey! Hey, guys. Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat. Sit. Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea. Yeah, sorry. Oh, it's just We haven't seen you guys all week. Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out. Yeah. Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel. Who the hell are these people? They just moved here from Hawaii. Py is a total foodie and Shea, well Mmm! She's SheaShea is just  Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks For a boat ride around the city. Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious. Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh We kind of think they might be the two. Ooh. Pfft, who needs 'em? Pfft. Not us. Hi. Two for dinner. Just the two of you?  Hey, why don't we call That weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo. After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic. Hey, guys. Barney, are you wearing sweat pants? Maybe. But they're Armani. Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, Couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?  Oh, yeah! That was amazing, Lily! I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, "what?!" You guys are the best. Oh, right back at you!  Ding. For charades. How do we know you two won't hurt us again? You don't. You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us. Then what are you doing, Standing out in the rain with us? Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy And girl? I think we can change them. Come here, you two. We'll never sleep on the gouda again. Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it? No, not really. 'twas the night before, I had hours to kill. I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill. With quill? Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said "classy," but her eyes whispered "sin. " She said, "you're a teacher?" I said, "yes, indeed. " "I must have you," she moaned. "I'm turned on by tweed. " With haste we did scamper To my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper. No way. You made that up. Are you coming back bed, professor? Whew! God, I love being single. Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall? What have I done? That meant sometimes she dressed a little differently. Okay, let's do this! Sometimes she talked a little differently. Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh? She hung out at different bars and enjoyed leisure time a little differently. You want to go? You want to go?! Come on! Make fun of the Great White North all you want. It's the best country in the world. The Mmmm. Social experiment. U. S. A. , U. S. A. Okay, okay. You know what, What does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people will join in. Canada, Canada, Cana Okay, they won't chant anything. Shrimp fried rice, Shrimp fried rice, Shrimp fried rice, Shrimp fried rice Shrimp fried rice-- totally. Anyway, speaking of food, Marshall, I've got so bad news. Just read online, Gazzola's is closing. No! What's Gazzola's? A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois. Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago Just for a Gazzola's pizza. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe. Man, those Gazzola trips, that's that's when we really became bros. Mm. We ate nothing but jerky. Drank nothing but Tantrum. Ah, Tantrum. Tantrum was a soft drink with the highest caffeine content legally available over the counter. It was eventually discontinued after an extensive study by the FDA. Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip. I was color-blind for two weeks after that. I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells. It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell. 30. I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One burned through the can, the other one I drank already. Tantrum! I am so psyched! Marshall and I haven't done something, just the two of us, for so long. Ever since he got married, he's turned from an "I" to a "we. " What do you mean? Think about it. Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing? We're doing great. Did you watch the Jets game? We most certainly did. How'd things go at the doctor? We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem. Hmm. You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing assault charges. Come on! I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported. Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!  Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen. Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard. Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am. I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this. Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow. A cit I'll think about it. No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on Okay, Barney. Sorry. It's a rich area. It is. But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test. How do you know the Canadian test is easy? It's Canada. Really? Ted! Ted! Check it out! I got black coffee on the left, I got Tantrum on the right! Do you have a phone book?! Yes, I do! I don't know why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?  Tantrum! Tantrum! All right, let's hit the road. You invited Lily? We most certainly did! I don't know if you caught that, but he did the "we" thing. Yeah, I heard him. Okay. Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women. Chicago. I have to pee. Couldn't you have gone before we left? I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see. Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times. It wasn't. And I would walk 500 more Sugar snap pea? Pea That reminds me, I have to pee. Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper. Ooh, punch buggy yellow! Ow! Yellow-- that reminds me, I have to pee. Thank you! Great. Oh, hey, Ted You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible. No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something. Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys. Good-bye, Sparky. It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry. Good-bye Sparky, by Nick Leotti. Read to you by Kenny Rogers. When I first saw Sparky, he reminded me of my favorite comb; he was missing a lot of teeth, but I loved him anyway. Mother was fit to be tied every time he used her prized rhododendron to do his business. That reminds me, I have to pee. "How many stars are on the flag?" "What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?" The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready. Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. "Who is this?" Queen Elizabeth II. No, the answer is Elton John. "What the hell is this?" Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played Wrong. The answer we were looking for was "I don't care, it's dumb. " Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin. because Sparky loved chasing a ball, and it didn't much matter what kind. Tennis ball, baseball, Wiffle ball, golf ball, basketball, beach ball, gum ball, a grapefruit-- which isn't actually a ball, but 's round like a ball-- a football-- which isn't round, but it's still technically a ball-- Indian rubber ball This ends disk seven. The audio book continues on disk eight. Disk eight. Lacrosse ball, volleyball Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee! Ah, I do. It was the worst trip ever, but then it got worse. Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there. Crumpet Manor is listed in the American Registry of Historic Bed-and-Breakfasts. Our door is opened on Christmas day, 1881. And we have catered to couples ever since. Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right? Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench? And by the end of the night, Barney had turned Robin into a real American. I want to say-- Jefferson? Correct. Oh! Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson. Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing On America right now! All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to-- who is this? That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the "Hey, Vern" guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name Jeff Foxworthy. Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that? Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face. Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your guns and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky-- you are an American. Look who's back from the wishing well. It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road. Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night. Besides, they have a spa. All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two-person, cornmeal body scrub? And then finally it happened. Marshall and Lily globbed into one big married glob. We'd love a cornmeal body scrub! Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. Maybe I'll rob a liquor store. Maybe I won't. My choice. Learn English! The Hoser Hut. I could duck in for a drink. No, no, that life's behind me. Forget it. Well, I could in for just one beer. What's the harm in that? It's a free country. Our home and native land Oh, God, I miss it. Shh. Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer? Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning. Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer? Chicago. What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak! She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun. I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?  And I would walk 500 more Hey, you really think Lily's pissed? If she's pissed, she's pissed. Pfft. When Barney finally tracked down your Aunt Robin, it wasn't a pretty sight. Good morning. Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night? You went Canadian. How Canadian? This Canadian. Oh. That was supposed to be a dramatic view of the Toronto sky-- you're in Toronto. Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut. . We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich tittle double bill in Toronto. How did you find me, anyway? You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic Canada isn't across the Atlantic. You're talking nonsense. Now, listen You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours. Barney, I'm not taking the test. God, you're still drunk. Look, I-I appreciate your help, but who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be. Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee In you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee. Kind of gross. You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22-hour drive. Just like old times! I feel so young again except for the chest pains. But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust? It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal. Cornmeal We'd love a cornmeal body scrub! I can't believe you guys are closing. I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger. It's like an entire country without a tailor. Yeah, give me two coffees. $3. 50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night? What game? The Leafs beat Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT. Oh, I guess I missed it. Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change. I'm not American. American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No "please" or "thank you" for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian. What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five-dollar bill they gave you is blue. Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either. And there's kids playing hokey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you. I don't want this anymore. Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake. We shouldn't have left Lily. Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call? I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, "I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!" What exactly is "Ted's fault"? This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me put on underwear! We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily. That is not true. It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away. Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's leaving. Car keys, please. Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back. When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe-- Tim Horton's-- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country. Okay, that's it. Attention, Canada! I am Barney from America. And I'm here to fix your backward-ass country. get real money. Don't know what board game this came from, but it's a "jhoke. " Number two-- and this is the biggie-- Quit letting awesome chicks like Robin Scherbatsky get away because, guess what? You don't want her? I'm planting my flag in her-- if you know what I mean, which you probably don't-- and getting her the hell out of here. You may now return to being pointless. Ah, this coffee is excellent. Oh. Hey, fellas. It's called a "tie. " Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us to make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows. I'm sorry, Ted! I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you! No, I never should have brought Lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros? Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times? Hells, yeah! Or listen to the Sparky book again? Listen to the Sparky book again. Okay. Let's listen to it again. Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're not idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday. Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, "Yeah, America's cool. " Hmm. And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, "Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too. " I-I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian. Wait, you can do that? Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two. I see. You understand? No, I can see out of my left eye again. Hey, baby? Baby? Hmm? Yeah? I'm so sorry that we left you. Did you go somewhere, sweetie? Yes, kids, it turns out Crumpet Manor had pampered Lily into a nearly comatose state of relaxation. She didn't even notice we were gone. Mmm. Oh, oh, oh  Yeah So, I had a great time, too. That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza. Oh, that's okay. And if she didn't mean it then, she certainly meant it God, my stomach! Damn you, Gozzola's!  It's like a hot ball of lead! Baby, cut it out of me. That was a wild trip, huh, Ted? I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again? You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right, Lil? Where's Lily? Tantrum! I have to pee. We hadn't met them yet, but we could hear them all the time. They were always Let's just say they were always "playing the bagpipes. " Okay, this is ridiculous. I can't believe those two are still bagpiping. I know. It's been six hours. Must be that tantric bagpipe that Sting is into. She keeps yelling out for him to play the bagpipes harder, but it sounds like he's bagpiping her pretty hard. There's a glass of water in my bedroom that's vibrating like Jurassic Park. You have neighbors! Shut the bagpipes up! . . I decided to go to the bar to get some peace and quiet. That didn't work out so well. I hate to have to be the one to tell you this. Marshall and Lily are getting a divorce. Baby, you mind washing that? No problem. I should go. She makes him wash his dishes right away, Ted. I give 'em two, maybe three weeks tops. That's not a big deal. And it's certainly not a big enough deal for you to be holding my hands. They're in big trouble. I see what's going on. You, my friend, are suffering from a little known condition "little known" because I just made it up, called "New Relationship Smugness". You and Robin are in the honeymoon phase. Everything's perfect. Every song on the radio's about you. Every other couple sucks. Enjoy it. N. R. S. doesn't last forever. It does when you're this awesome. Check it out. Robin and I have been keeping a tally of how many beds we've done it in. We're up to 83-and-a-half. A half? in an antique shop. How ya holding up? Do you need a hug? You want to talk about yesterday? Safe space. He thinks Lily asking you to wash your dishes right away is a sign your marriage is crumbling. What? Why? Lily likes a clean sink, so I do the dishes;what's the big deal? I'll tell you what the big deal is. You know how I was always the best at being single? Now I am the best at relationships. Even better than you and Lily. Look at you. Had a girlfriend for 5 minutes, You think you can play with the big boys adorable. Son, I've been in a relationship since you had a ponytail and were playing Dave Matthews on your mama's Casio. I'm a good boyfriend in my sleep. I can rock a killer foot rub with one hand and brew a kick-ass pot of chamomile in the other that would make you weep. Hell, I've forgotten more about microwaving fat-free popcorn and watching Sandra Bullock movies than you'll ever know, but thanks for your concern, rook. Do you mind if there is a sink full of dirty dishes? Not really. Then it's Lily's problem, not yours. But if I said that to her, it would only lead to a fight, so You fight. See, Robin and I never fight. every time it looks like we're about to get into a fight Why is there a bag of panties labeled "April 2008" in your closet? So any time you think you might have a fight, you just get up and leave? Can't fight if you're not there. That's what Gandhi taught us. That's not true. I can't believe that Robin puts up with that. Don't worry. She's got a great way to avoid fights, too. Are ties machine washable? No, they most certainly are not. Why? What is in your hand? My God, what's in your hand?! Okay, so you walk away. Robin gets naked. Those are the two stupidest ways to handle conflict I've ever heard. The naked thing ain't bad. But when a problem comes up, Lily and I actually talk about it. There are so many great things to do with the human mouth. Why waste it on talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say about the dishes if I were Lily's husband. Barney, you're home! Dude! - Get to the point! - All right. Thanks, doll. Sweetie, are you going to wash that? I'm glad you bring that up. No. And here's why. Lily, I know you don't like a dirty sink. But does that make it my job to keep it clean? I mean, if one day I look up at the living room ceiling and think, "Hey, I'd like a replica of the Sistine Chapel up there. " Would it be your job to paint it? No. Of course not. Exactly! So, baby, by the same logic, if you don't like looking at a sink full of dishes, shouldn't it be your job to clean them? Thanks for explaining that. I get so confused. That's because you're a woman. You're kidding me with this. Hang on, Ted. Let's hear the man out. Once I have her attention, it's time to bring out the big guns. Look, I love you. But, baby, with the little energy I have left after work, I want to shower you with love, not wash some silly dishes. You're right. I'll do the dishes. Right after I do this. Now turn around. Firm. No, he's not. Marshall, look at me. Do not get drawn into Barney Stinson's circus tent of funhouse mirrors and flawed logic. This is exactly how you got the earring back in '03. No, he isn't. I hate doing my dishes right away. Hey, guys. Good. There you are. You'll tell me the truth. Barney says that you two never fight. No way. I love you both, but you are the two most emotionally ill-equipped individuals in the history of relationships. You two must have had at least one fight. You know what? We did. There was one small dispute about which one of us was more awesome. We just called it a tie Sand had sex. Speaking of which, I am so glad we're going skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors are driving me crazy. Yeah, it's bad. We all have our assignments for the weekend. Ted, you're going to stand up to your neighbors and you to Lily. Robin, I'm gonna need you in sort of a crouched position on the bear-skin rug at our ski chalet. Ready? - Bye, guys. Have fun. You know? With his crazy, well- thought-out theories that probably would work. Marshall, I'm just gonna say this one more time. Two more times. It's a bad idea. Listen, Barney lays out some logical points Lily is a reasonable woman. I think that if I explain it to her, she'll get it and I'll get my way. No. She'll get mad, and you'll get in a huge fight. Baby, could you wash your dishes? Lily, I'm glad that you bring that up. Can I stay here tonight? I'll make up the sofa, buddy. The ski bunnies are back! Hey, guys. We just spent the whole weekend cuddling by the fire. No black diamonds, but a lot of red hearts. Man. What the hell has gotten into you two? When did you become so nauseating? Isn't it great to finally see her fulfilled emotionally, spiritually and sexually? I dated her for a year. How was your weekend? Terrible, and it's all your fault, okay? I took your stupid advice! Baby, could you wash your dishes? Lily, I'm glad that you bring that up. And here is why So, it's like this, okay? Sure. You want me to go ahead and wash my dish. But maybe I want you to paint the ceiling, right? Like, maybe I should say "I'll wash my dish if you get up there "and just you paint naked babies on the ceiling. " You know? It's just like I don't know what happened. I'm a lawyer. I argue for a living, but when it comes to Lily, I just get all flustered. How could you not? I mean, the girl's all eyes and boobs. What happened to the "I'm tired after my draining day, "and I want to use my leftover energy showering you with love" argument? I should have written that down. Look, Lily, I I make more money than you. Excuse me?! Dance for me. Dude. It all made so much sense when you said it, but when I said it, it turned into a fight. And once Lily and I start fighting, the fight starts to mutate and multiply. Sure, it started with the dishes, but then So you're saying that you shouldn't have to wash dishes because you work harder than me? That's not what I'm saying but it's true. And then all of sudden, we're fighting about who works harder. I teach kindergarten. I am molding the future leaders of tomorrow. You eat cookies and glue stuff. And soon more fights spin off. I can't believe you'd rather be killed Until there're more fights going on than you can keep track of. If you need to go in the middle of the night, either turn the bathroom light on or sit down. My mother does not hate you. She is neutral about you. I am not scared of your shining impression. I just don't need to hear it, especially at night. Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance. Please don't do that. Man, Lily fights dirty. She's small, but vicious like a badger that your brother's caught and starved for five days and then put in your sleeping bag. I should go home and apologize. What you need is a surge. Fight harder. Picture it, Marshall. Never having to wash another dish as long as you live, yet all the dishes are always clean. Why, this would take all the anxiety out of snacking. No more holding open your shirt to form a makeshift bowl for your salty treats. That world is yours, Marshall. Reach out, take it, dip it in some ranch dressing, enjoy. Yes, right. Barney's stupid ideas are what got you into this quagmire. There's no exit strategy. Just wash your stupid dishes. Those dishes are my manhood! And if I want to leave my manhood dirty in the sink, caked with ketchup and pasta - What are you eating? - Then damn it, that's my right! I'll wash my manhood when I'm good and ready! Where was he not sitting? Barnstormer! Ro-Ro! Now you have adorable nicknames? Seriously, what's going on with your two? Nothing. We're just happy. It's like Gandhi said "A smile don't cost nothing, sugar. " I'm not sure you know who Gandhi is. So, did you talk to our neighbors? I did. I went up there ready to set them straight. They're old? Really old. So what did you do? I didn't have the heart to tell stop, because, well, good for them. So I just welcomed them to the building, had a hard candy, nodded politely at some racist comments and then left. Over the next couple of days, Barney and Robin continued to be happier than ever. And Marshall and Lily continued to fight. I don't care if the dishes aren't done. If you care, you do it. Great. Then I don't care if you have an orgasm. If you care, you do it. I went 18 years without the touch of a woman. I can do it again. You might have to. And I continued to hear more bagpiping than a St. Patty's Day parade. I don't know what to do. Lily and I have never had a fight this long. It's like I don't even exist. On Sunday morning, she made pancake, Ted. Pancake and bacon strip. It's your own fault. You took relationship advice from Barney. Well, maybe Barney has it all figured out. He and Ro-Ro are the best couple now. All that cutesy, lovey-dovey crap, that's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames. Thanks, Robbsy-Wobbsy. I don't do nicknames. Finished with the sports page, Sherbs? Seriously, stop. Robin, it's T-Mose. I don't like them on you either. Well, she obviously likes them now. And, come on, somebody had to put an end to T-Mose. T-Mose was awesome. I'm thinking of bringing it back. Bagpiping sounds different today. It's all echo-y. They're in the bathroom. I think they're bagpiping on the shower chair. And just like that, I realized exactly how to get the real scoop on Barney and Robin. How are Marshall and Lily? I worry about those two, I really do. You and your big, giant heart. Enough. The jig is up. Whatever do you mean? Who's this guy? We'll get to that. You see, I knew something was wrong. You two were too happy, too shiny, too nickname-y. Didn't add up. You two never fight? Horse apples. You fight all the time. How would you know that? Phil told me. Who the hell is Phil? Your downstairs neighbor. I'm Phil. And he's heard everything. So Phil tells me that Ro-Ro and the Barnstormer have been fighting a lot. Care to explain? Everything was going great. Our no-fighting techniques were working perfectly until we went on that ski trip last weekend. So I showed Marshall that Lily's argument was bananas, and now he'll never have to wash another dish. High two. That's terrible advice. You agree with Lily? You We're about to get in a fight, and I can't run away. I can't take my clothes off. It's freezing up here. I get hypothermia. Maybe I can jump it? Maybe just my pants? This no-fighting thing is over. I think so. We've been fighting ever since. All those fights we kept not having they all came back around. The tiny camera I found in the headboard. That's how a quarterback stays sharp. Monday morning, he sits on a bag of ice and studies the game tape. It was sort of nice to be the perfect couple for a minute. I knew you were lying. You got to wake up pretty early to slip one by the T-Mose. Stop it. Dinner's ready. Did you make any for me? No, but it's your favorite. We need your advice. So Barney and Robin told them all about their fighting. And let's just say, that in comparison, their little dishes spat seemed pretty tame. And by the end, Lily and Marshall both had the same reaction. I'll wash my dishes right away from now until the day I die. I don't care when you wash the dishes. But if it's with cheese-based like a nice ziti, at least soak it. Of course, baby. I love you. I love you, too. See? How did you just do that? How'd you just fix everything? I don't know. I guess sometimes you just have to set your ego aside. And remember that the love that you have for that other person is way more important than winning. More important than winning. Stop, stop it. Seriously, what's the secret? Look, the honeymoon period may be over, but now you can get into the real stuff. And honestly, that's the best part. Good night. So what do we do now? I guess we got to start talking more and get into the real stuff. Or there's a bench in the elevator. That's better. So what if we're not the best couple? Totally. It's not a competition. We win! Best couple in the world! Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So we can just throw them away. That means no dirty dishes in the sink. You're dirty. Maybe I should leave you in the sink. And once that first argument got worked out, all those other arguments, well, they got better, too. But nice to meet you. Barney Stinson. And yet, in the fall of 2009, he was the one with the girlfriend. Go ahead. Open it. Open it! Open it! Open it! Open it! It's my porn collection! Just kidding. That would be weird. It's your porn collection. It's my porn collection! I'm giving you my porn. Now that things are so great with Robin, I don't need it anymore. Wow, you are voluntarily giving up your porn? You really are serious. Yeah, well, that's obvious. What does that mean? Oh, nothing, it's just, you know, you got relationship gut. What?! No, I do not "got relationship gut. " That is ridiculous. It's no big deal. I mean, once you're dating someone, it's natal to let things go a little bit. Trust me, we've been there. Yeah. Boy, did i pudge you out for a while. Well, we should get going. Good-bye, my sweet, beloved friends. You have always been there for me. You'll be missed. He's talking to the porn. Oh. Bye, Robin. See you, Robs. Bye, guys. God, look at these videos. Space Orgy? Horny Co-Ed Surprise Party 23? You'd think after the first 22 parties, the co-eds wouldn't be surprised anymore. So, uh we can get rid of these for you. Yeah. No. No-no-no-no-no-no. It's not a problem. I'll-I'll take care of them. Are you sure? Mm-hmm. I mean, no biggie. We can just swing by the back alley and drop the box in the Dumpster. I see six of the words you just id on this video label. Seriously, it's not a big deal. I will take care of it. No, 'cause I, I mean Leave them! Okay. You know, in a way it sad, right? I mean, Barney's giving up his porn. He's got relationship gut. They eat at the same diner every night. It-it's, like, the end of Barney Stinson as we know him. Yeah, well, so what? They're happy. Yeah, well, we gotta go. Later. Bye. Bye-bye. So what'd you get? I got Squat. What are you? I thought I saw you take one. Yeah, I did. It's called Squat. Hmm ArchiSexTure. That is not how you spell "Buckminster Fuller. " Kids, pornography is bad, and so I was getting rid of that vile pornography right away I am getting rid of this vile pornography right away. when something terrible happened. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. ArchiSexTure Hello, Ted. If you are watching this tape-- and I knew you'd pick this one-- then you are now in possession of my porn. either I'm dead, or m in a committed relationship. If I'm dead, I want you to honor my memory by taking my body to the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie's. I want to dance. I want to have sex with a girl. And I want to go fishing. please, for the love of God, get out of it! . Corrected by Alex28 I might look happy, but don't believe it. Barney Stinson is meant to be single. So please, if you value my best-friendship-- that's right, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how does that feel?-- then get me out of this. And finally, since you were expecting some porn No, no, no baby, don't worry. The flashing green light means it's off. Are we sure he was finished talking? Look, there's reason we should take this seriously, right? Of course not. This is an old tape. Barney is happy with Robin. But over the next couple weeks, I started to notice things. Barney and Robin stopped having crazy adventures. So what'd you guys do last night? I wanted to go to a concert. He wanted to go to a party. Obviously, we couldn't do what just one of us wanted, so we just stayed in, watched a movie on It was Legen-- wait for it-- ds of the Fall. Legends of the Fall! It was okay. Barney stopped being himself. Hey, Barney, I'm, uh, I'm chatting up this girl over there, and I could use a little help landing the plane. Sorry, Ted, I'm my own wingman tonight. And Robin got annoyed at everything he said. So, how are u two? So great. Oh shut up. Relationships are the best. Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up The sharing, the compromise, The monogamy, can't beat it. Catchphrase! Yes! But the worse they got I'm full sweetie. the more they kept saying things were great. Now, the truth is, Barney and Robin only kind of let themselves go a little bit. But I swear, after a few more weeks, to us, they seemed like this. I'll be there in a minute. Hey. They're killing each other. They love each other. Barney and Robin love each other, but they're not Barney and Robin anymore. They're the fat guy and the old lady. My favorite '70s detective show. Look, it's so ear. Barney's been overeating because he hates being tied down like this. And Robin's stressing out because she hates what Barney's turned into. No, they're a perfect match. Well, maybe that's the problem. Maybe they're too similar. It must be tough having two alpha dogs in one relationship. We have two alpha dogs in our relationship. Sure we do, sweetie. If they're not happy, why don't they just break up? Because they're too stubborn. Neither one of them wants to be the first to admit that they want out. They're playing Relationship Chicken. I think Barney ate the relationship chicken. Ted, it's just a rough patch. It takes time getting used to being with someone else. And they're both What the nice word for selfish? Independent. Independent. Every relationship goes through this. It's true, um, I have this astronaut friend-- totally loved his fiancée. And then, the day before his mission she caught him with, like, four other chicks, a couple of dudes. Things got really tense. Um, finally, she ended up sneaking onto the space shuttle Are you talking about Space Orgy? Yes, I am. Ted, it's just a rough patch. Just let things run their course. She's right. But Two-to-one, Ted. Leave them alone So I did leave them alone. But that weekend Have you noticed how beef ribs used to always be disgusting, and then recently, they found a way to make them really delicious instead? Okay, Barney, I'm going to go ahead and ask you this head-on Are you happy with Robin? Are you kidding?! How could I not be happy with Robin? It's Robin! So are you happy? I can't believe you would even ask me that. Every moment's a battle. So are you happy? Do you know what goes hand in hand with fighting? The makeup sex. Which is different when you're in a loving, long-term relationship. Heads we have sex, tail we order a whole pizza and just lay here moaning. Oh, great. Let the coin decide. Which was pizza again? Tails. It was tails. Sex-- am I right? Thank God that's mostly over. I'm still hungry. You hungry? We have to break them up. You're right. Barney and Robin are miserable together, but they're too stubborn to admit it. So we had to get them to break up. How do we do that? We unleash the Kraken. Kids, as you know, earlier that year I'd learned that Lily had broken up not one, not two, but seven of my past relationships. Forget it. I'm retired. I'm out of the game. But nobody's better than you. I'm telling you, I swore off that rocket. I've gone legit. I'm a matchmaker now. Set me up with someone. Whoa, I'm just starting out. Please. You've, you've got to break them up. This relationship is killing them. I know it is, but I've learned my lesson. No more interfering. Let things run their course. It's two-to-one. Yes, but t one is me. All right, we don't need her. We can break them up on our own. How? Okay remember when Robin and I were dating? What was the one big thing that really freaked her out? No, no, no, no, no--Ted, you can't. No! No-no-no! What are you talking about? This! This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne? If we make Robin think for even a second that Barney is proposing, she'll lose it and they'll break up. That's crazy. Why don't we just, uh, like, lead Barney into temptation? We'll find some hot woman hit on him Okay, the ring thing. Stakeout van. What? We should've gotten a stakeout van. We could've ordered pizza, look through big binoculars and said, "This ain't what I signed up for," stuff like that. Shh, here comes the waiter. Please shut up. What? Oh, I thought you said something, sorry. Is that an engagement ring? Are you? Oh, no. No. That is not . They must have delivered it to the wrong table. Can you imagine us getting married? Well, we are committed to each other. Most of your stuff is already at my apartment. It might make taxes easier. It'd speed up your citizenship. "Scherbatsky" is so hard to spell. My mom would be so happy. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, no reason not to. We're getting married! Not so loud, geez. What did you do? I am furious right now! This is so wrong! Lily, will you be my maid of honor? Oh, my God! I would love to! Are you out of your mind?! You knew they were playing Relationship Chicken, And what did you do? You put an engagement ring in front of them! Okay, that's it. I'm taking over. Coming out of retirement for one, last breakup. Oh-ho! All right. Oh, yes! How are we going to do it? These guys are in so deep, just one fight ain't going to do it. We need to reignite the four biggest fights they've ever been in all at once. The Battle of the Dirty Dishes. The Ex-Girlfriend Conflict. Hey. Don't you know that girl over there? No, I don't think . No, in fact, I have definitely not-- Oh, hey, it's Meg. Wow, I am certainly not comparing you two in my mind right now. Whoops! Hey, will you get that for me, please? Really? What's the problem? I'm not Why do you keep-- You're embarrassing me in public. Youre constantly putting me in these positions. The Star Wars Altercation. Isn't it time you got rid of your stupid doll? It's not a doll. It's a Storm Trooper. Uh, he's wearing a diaper. It's not a diaper, Robin, it's protective armor. Storm Trooper? More like storm-pooper. Stop it. Oh! Oh, it sounds like your storm-pooper here needs a changing. Okay, you know what? I'm sick of it. What? I didn't say anything. The Canadian/American War. Thank God that song's over. Who the hell was that old lady singing? Okay, you know that Neil Young is my favorite musician. Right. Now, was that the same old lady who played Archie Bunker's wife in All in the Family, or just sound-alike? Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young. Robin, I would never make fun of a defenseless old lady with vocal cord paralysis ever. Oh, here we go. In public? Really? In public? Yeah, in public. I'll go there. What's the problem? Everything I say We're gonna have a fight in public? I got it. I got it. We e-mail them pictures reminding them of each of these fights. You child. Here's how it goes down. First, rekindling the Canadian-American debate, Ontario native Alan Thicke stops by the table. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Alan Thicke? Oh, right. Robin knew him back when she was a singer. Yeah, and they still keep in touch. I already got his number off her phone. Seriously amateurs. So Alan Thicke restarts the Canada-U. S. fight. Right at that moment, Crazy Meg shows up. Then, a stormtrooper happens to walk by the window. And just when they can't take anything more, a busboy walks by with a tray full of what? Dirty dishes. Lily. This is your masterpiece. We're getting a stakeout van! A station wagon? Really? You rented a station wagon? Yeah, a van cost, like, 25 bucks more. A station wagon? Greetings, Will Robinson! Where's the birthday boy or girl? Hey, climb on in. What the hell is this? Oh, they didn't have any stormtroopers, so I had to get a different robot; this'll still work. Different robot? Stormtroopers aren't robots. Of course they're robots! "Must kill Luke Skywalker. " Um, nobody says that in Star Wars at all, ever. That's a really lousy robot voice, honey. Someone order an extra large sausage? Hey, one of Barney's videos starts off just like that. Hey, guys, Barney's ordering five of something. I don't know if it's gonna fit in here. Okay, now you're just quoting the video. Still ordering. Waiter's taking out a second pad. Yeah, okay, well, we need it in here. We're on a stakeout. Shouldn't you be in a van? Thank you! A van cost more. Score me a slice, Will Robinson! No, no-no-no! You get a stain on that costume, they're gonna charge us. Dude, will you just chill about money? Yeah, let the stormtrooper have a slice. It's not a stormtrooper! Hi, Lily Sorry I'm late. I was looking for a van. Thank you! $25! So should I go say hi to Robin? Oh, not yet; get in the car. Okay, so wait, wait, wait. When they blew up the Death Star, knowing full well there were thousands of stormtroopers on it, those were people? It was called the Death Star, baby. They knew what they were getting into. Look, I don't want to play the "I'm Alan Thicke" card, but I really do have a dinner to get to. Someone has got to take this sausage! Okay, were you in that video? Were you the guy with the farmer tan? Jonesin' for some 'za, Will Robinson! Come on, I'm Alan Thicke! This ain't what I signed up for. Hey! That's what Hey, you know what? Everyone, stop! Alan Thicke, shut up! Marshall, it's a station wagon. It's not a stormtrooper! Crap! They see us! Danger! Danger! Are you sure they saw us? Yes. Hey! Can I go talk to Barney now? I'm so excited! Do you really think he's going to propose to me? Oh, honey Forget it, Crazy Meg, we've been made. If we try anything now, they're going to know it's us. I, I think we should all just go home No! This is my masterpiece. So what if they saw us? It'll still work. Stop it. We'll think of something else. "I am Alan Thicke. " You're Alan Thicke?! No. Alan Thicke, you're up. Get on out there. And so, Lily followed through with her plan. First, Alan Thicke. Followed by Crazy Meg. Then, the robot. And finally, the dirty dishes. They're kissing? They shouldn't be kissing! Why isn't this working? Because they're in love. It really was just a rough patch. What the hell am I doing? This whole thing was a mistake. So, uh, any of you dudes want to get high? I never thought I'd be saying this tonight, but to Barney and Robin, the happy couple. That was the moment we learned that relationships take hard work, but eventually, everything will work out. Oh, hey! Where's Barney? Uh, we broke up. And that was the moment we unlearned that other lesson we had just learned a few seconds earlier. You see, earlier that night, when Lily thought Barney and Robin had spotted her, this is what they really saw. Why do that fat guy and old lady keep sta? Oh, my God. That's us! Look at us. Did always look this awful? Robin, I'm not happy. I mean, I wish I was. Nothing would make me happier than being happy, but I'm not. What are we doing wrong? We love each other. I mean, if this don't work, what will? We're so similar. We both like scotch. We're both awesome. You know, maybe that's it. Maybe there's just too much awesome here. Exactly. Two awesomes cancel each other out, and I'm tired of being cancelled out. Me, too. Are we breaking up? I think so. Ah, crap. Now comes the next part. The part where you and can't go back to being friends. Well, maybe this isn't a breakup. Maybe this is two friends getting back together. Robin! Ooh! Alan Oh, it's always so great to see a fellow hoser. Yes! Oh, is true. Barney! Good news! I forgive you for the whole restraining order thing. Uh, hi. Whoa, is that a stormtrooper? That's not a stormtr You want to get out of here? Yeah. See you guys. Okay. See you, Alan. So you still on 73rd Street? How do you know that? Getting back together as friends I like that. One more for the road? And, I mean, who knows? Maybe, when, like, you turn 40, if you haven't found anyone Oh, I already have that deal with Ted. Oh, right. Stupid. Well, maybe when you turn 39, if you haven't found anyone It turns out that they really did just need to let things run their course. So, uh, how's Barney doing? He's okay, I think. It might be a while before he fully recovers, but. Ooh! Did you guys just feel a chill? Yeah. Daddy's home. Well, Robin, I'm glad we could catch up. Oh, yeah, let's do it again soon. I love that you guys are still friends so long after you did that music video. Yeah. The music? Oh, the "Sandcastles" video, yes! Yes, we did that together, too. What do you mean "too"? Oh, we had this failed Canadian TV variety show we did. That was so embarrassing. Imagine what would happen if anybody ever got their hands on that? Oh, you. Uncle Barney was really good at that last one, even though a lot of the time who he was was someone else. Hi. Do you see that guy over there in the scuba suit? You thinking of going and talking to him? No. Good. He's seriously the biggest jerk on the face of the Earth. How do you know him? Oh, he's one of my best friends. So what's with the scuba suit? Well, it's a long story. There's two basic philosophies of how to handle yourself after a breakup. Some people throw themselves into My career. That's my number one focus right now. From now on, no more dating. It's all about work. While others throw themselves into Every woman in New York City. That's right, Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mothers, lock up your daughters. Daughters, lock up your MILSWANCAs. MILSWANCAs? Wait, I can get this. Mothers I'd Like To Sleep With And Never Call Again. Correct! Cile gets the square. Don't you think you're kinda rushg back into this? Lily, since I started dating Robin, there's a certain thing I haven't used as much as I would like to. It's kinda big, surprisingly heavy, kind of leathery, and it's black. Huh? This, my friends is The Playbook. Corrected by cRaZyMaGgOt and Alex28 The Playbook contains every scam, con, hustle, hoodwink, gambit, flimflam, stratagem and bamboozle I've ever used-- or ever hope to use-- to pick up chicks and give them the business. Wow, you wrote another book? Uh we got a Stephen King over here. It's all in here. Everything from basic moves like "The Don't Drink That. " Whoa, don't drink that. I saw some guy slip something in there. What? Who? Uh that guy. Thank you. To more advanced maneuvers like "The Mrs. Stinsfire. " Now Kappas, after our disciplinary hearing for lewd behavior last semester, we have been aigned a new housemom. I'd like you to meet Mrs. Stinsfire. Hello, girls! Wow. I can't picture a way that wouldn't work. What's "The Loreo Von Matterhorn"? I'm glad you asked. "The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn" will be my grand return to the stage. Or you know, the bed. Actually, my bed is kind of on a stage. I put a platform underneath, and got some lights going. It's a real production. Barney exits! So, how about you, Robin? You getting back out there? Where is your playbook? My playbook? Yeah. Bro, uh, two-volume set, right here. It's a great read actually. Yeah, I'm reading it right now. Anyway, I told you already, I'm taking a break from all that. Mm, mm. Marshall, it's totally gonna happen. So gonna happen. What's gonna happen? You're gonna fall in love. So soon. Not likely I'm focusing on my career. I'm done with dating. Oh, okay, we playing The Pyramid? Okay, uh, "Things people say right before they meet the love of their life. Hey, law school'so hard, I just want to focus on my studies. Oh, I'm so over the whole dating game. I just want to focus on my Star Trek fan fiction. Oh, I'm gonna die single and alone. I might as well just focus on this year's taxes. Six months later? Protest all you want, but it's gonna happen. It's a law of nature. Lawyered. Of nature. Believe me, I'd love to have no interest in a relationship. There's no way I'd be single right now if I wanted to be single. Okay, now you're ready. Ready for what? Three years ago, this girl Shelly started teaching at my school. The moment I saw her, I was like, "This is the girl for Ted." Why am I just hearing about her now? Ah You know, I usually hate being set up but this Ted just sounds so great. Oh, he is. He's so sweet and thoughtful and intelligent. Come on buddy! One more chicken finger and the crown is yours! Hmm, I don't see him anywhere. He must be out doing charity work. That girl with Lily's pretty cute! Oh, yeah she was cute. Yeah, still is. And now you're ready. Yeah, bro, now you can fit like, three times as many chicken fingers in your mouth. You know it. Okay, I will set it up, but promise me you won't do anything stupid. I promise I won't do anything stupid. And I kept that promise. But only because she never showed up. I know. I'm sorry, I feel terrible. You should feel teible! I do feel terrible! I do! You should! You should! You should! I do, I do! I don't. Look, I was really looking forward to meeting Ted, but I got to the bar an hour early and I met this amazing guy. Like, seriously amazing. And you met him at MacLaren's? Yeah, right at the bar. What's his name? I shouldn't say. Oh, what the heck. It's Lorenzo Von Matterhorn! You son of a bitch. So, he hooked up with Shelly? You must've been pissed. Damn straight. Barney, I've had Shelly set aside for Ted for three years. Dude, Ted was not missing out. She's brainy and annoying, kind of boring in the sack. Oh, I guess she would've been perfect for Ted. Oops. Ow! Ok. Had I known that she was there to meet Ted, of course I wouldn't have done it, but given the circumstances, I think Ted'll be proud of me. I pulled off "The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn." Okay, what's the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn? My question exactly. Okay, what's the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn? Glad you asked. Basic knowledge of Web site design and a very unique fake name. So, think of your fake name right now. Have you got it? Good. Now, select your target. Preferably a girl with a real ni phone. Yeah, it's me. Do I know you? I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. Are you, like, famous or something? Yes. What a refreshing change of pace. Nice to meet you Shelly. Shelly. Once again, I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. Spelled like it sounds two "T"s. Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. Ciao. Then, as soon as you're gone, she gets out her phone and does an Internet search for Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. And that's when she discovers. a series of fake Web sites, all devoted to the incredible life of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. There's the fake business article about Lorenzo, the reclusive billionaire. The fake Explorers Club newsletter describing his balloon trek to the North Pole as a feat of pure daring and imagination. The fake medical journal featuring the heartbreaking story of doctors telling him penis reduction surgery isn't an option. And by the time you get back. . Hi, Shelly, uh, I hate to be forward, but can I buy you a cup of coffee? Yes! Please. Oh, Lorenzo. And it is on. That's awful. You realize you broke her heart, right? She's inconsolable. Why would she be inconsolable? Lorenzo's balloon won't disappear over the Arctic for another week. The only way she would be upset is if someone told her it was all a bunch of lies. It was all just a bunch of lies? It was all just a bunch of lies. The balloon expedition? Lies! The man-made island shaped like his face off the coast of Dubai? Lies! Finishing third in the laser tag competition? Li-- Oh, actually, that one's true. I went to that. You went to the Vatican? Lies! Oh, my God! Well, I hope you're happy with yourself. What? You broke that girl's heart. Me? You! She'll probably never trust a guy again. You ruined her for Ted. Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn, Lorenzo's twin brother. Can you believe that? He blames me Oh, and by the way, Ted, I bet she'd still go out with you. Hmm, let me think. Do I want to go out with a girl Barney hooked up with? Guys, help me out with the harmonies. Sure. Well, you must be a little bothered by this. Well, it's his life. Look, if these girls are dumb enough to fall for this crap, Agreed. Have you seen the one there labeled "The SNASA"? Wow, you're an astronaut? Shh! I'm actually in a top secret government space program called Secret NASA or SNASA. Wow, SNASA. Mm-mm. Do you go to the Moon and stuff? Well, not the Moon you're familiar with, though I have been to the Smoon. Wow, the Smoon. If you fall for that one, my heart breaks for you, but I'm sorry, you're a smoron. So, what happens next? Well Come on, Barney, you just You just got out of an honest to God relationship. You're a real boy now. You can't go back to these cheap tricks. Cheap tricks?! Not one of these is a cheap trick. Except for "The Cheap Trick." I'm the bass player for Cheap Trick. And even that one involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you don't mind, I am off to prepare for tonight's main event. I will be performing "The He's Not Coming." Glad you asked. The observation deck of the Empire State Building. Are you there? Good. For generations, this has been the spot New Yorkers have chosen for their romantic reunions with long-estranged lovers, so all you have to do is walk up to every girl you see and say "He's not coming." What are you talking about? Never mind. He's not coming. He's not coming... She's not coming? Sorry. Until sooner or later  He's not coming. He's not? But we agreed. We always said we'd meet here. On this night. I'm such a fool. Shh, shh, shh All right, I'm going to go get the paper. More like, go get a husband. Totally. Okay, you guys need to stop that, seriously. The last thing I am looking for right now is a relationship. Uh-huh. When you pick up that newspaper, be sure to check the wedding announcements. For yours. Robin, it's like this. Do you have any idea how many times in my life I've gone to t freezer looking for frozen waffles and not found them? Thousands? Millions. But when I go to the freezer looking for a Popsicle-- or the remote control because Lily and I are having a fight and she's hidden it there-- you know what I find? Frozen waffles. That's how it works. You go out there looking for a paper, you're coming back with frozen waffles. And, in this case, frozen waffles is a guy. Also, could you pick up some frozen waffles? In that case, frozen waffles are frozen waffles. Guys, code red! Emergency. Lock down. Nobody's leaving. Whoa, what happened? I tried "The He's Not Coming," and it worked. Gangbusters. You should have seen this girl. Bang, ping, pa-dowga-donk. Okay, I'm leaving. So, we get up to my place, and I go into my room to set up the camera-- to light the candles-- and when I come out, she's gone, and so is The Playbook! I think we all know who is responsible for this. Yeah, we do. Yeah. Al-Qaeda. No, you idiot. It was me. You son of a bitch. Wow, you stole The Playbook? So, the girl on the Empire State Building? A friend of mine-- an actress. An actress. Of course. That explains her impeccable diction and her sluttiness. Barney, I've got half a mind to take that playbook and put it up on the internet for the whole world to see. You wouldn't. I won't, as long as you agree to no more scams, no more cons, no more hustles, no more hoodwinks, no more gambits, no more stratagems and no more bamboozles. I notice you left out flimflams. No more flimflams! Damn it. Oh, my God. I-I'm sorry to interrupt, but look at this. No. I got left at the altar. Oh, my God, that's horrible. I wonder if that would work. That's not even the worst one in here. Have you guys seen, uh, "My Penis Grants Wishes"? Really? A genie comes out of it? Only if you rub it hard enough. So, then, what happened? It says here he breaks into song, and then the furniture comes to life and dances with him. It's not very well thought out. It's no "Mrs. Stinsfire. " No, what happened in real life? Well, a few hours later  You know, I heard it was gonna rain. If anyone's interested, I will be at MacLaren's Pub performing a play out of The Playbook entitled "The Scuba diver" That is all. Okay, that's it. I'm putting The Playbook up on the Internet. Baby, can you put The Playbook up on the Internet? Yeah. Of course, baby, but here's the here's the weird thing. I have literally been through this book cover to cover. There is no play in here called "The Scuba Diver." Oh. So, now you guys want to know what "The Scuba Diver" is. Well, it was on the last page of The Playbook, but I ripped it out just in case. Don't worry, though, You're about to see it in action. See the blond over there by the bar? Tizzarget acquizzired. Barney, don't do this. You're so Ah, give it a rest, pest. If anyone should be mad, it should be Rob. She loves The Playbook. I don't love The Playbook. What are you talk? The Playbook-- it's gold. You got to admit it's pretty spectacular. Look, Barney, we just broke up. I mean, yes, the costumes are cute, but we just broke up. Well, I didn't I didn't know you felt that way. I guess I've been so wrapped up in my own stuff that I Oh, crap, she's looking over he. Quick, everyone, scatter. That's it. Hi. You see at guy over there in the scuba suit? And that brings us to rig now. Wow. But wait. So, why is he wearing scuba gear? We don't know. And it's killing us, Claire. It's killing us! Let's go ask him. So, what's "The Scuba Diver"? And this Claire, by the way. Hello, Claire. My name is Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train bomb sniffing dolphins for the Balt You know what? I'm I can't I can't I can't do this. Robin I'm so sorry. I guess this breakup's been tougher on me than I thought. I think this playbook was just a way to take my mind It's okay. It's been tough on me, too. I mean, look at me. I've sworn off relationships. She's so about to get married. I got to work on my toast. I got to make sure my tux fits. I will bang your heads together like coconuts. Barney, I'm so glad you're stopping this. And-and, frankly, the real Barney is way cooler than any of the fake Barney's in this any book. Oh, is that right? Claire, you've probably heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want to grab a cup of coffee? Claire, before you turn him down, I-I think you should know that under this neoprene suit with what appears to be a tube sock stuffed in the crotch. Can of Pringles, but go on. is an amazing guy. He's fun and one of my best friends. And he landed this hottie. He's a good guy. Come on, Claire, go out with him. It's just a cup of coffee, right? Right? Come on. Yeah. Can't hurt. All right, all right. Let's t some coffee. And by the end of the night I'm prd of that guy. To be that vulnerable takes a lot of Prings. Ooh. I got a text from Barney. Oh. "Look under the table." Oh. It's a page from The Playbook. What does it say? It's "The Scuba Diver." tell a meddlesome female friend about The Playbook. run play on one of her coworkers, making her so angry that she steals the Playbook. Put on a scuba suit and tell her you're going to do one more scam called "The Scuba Diver" on the hot girl standing by the bar. Your friend-- let's call her Lily-- goes and talks to the girl and tells her everything about The Playbook. Now, here's where it gets tricky. When Lily and the girl ask at "The Scuba Diver" is, tell them about your deep-seated insecurities which don't really exist because-- let's face it-- you're awesome. Feeling bad for you, Lily talks you up to the girl, who then agrees to go get coffee with you. And it. is. on. You son of a bitch. I'll give you a call. All right. Bye-bye. Uh, for those of you keeping score, "The Ted Mosby" works. Shh. Robin, here we go. Say you don't want a relationship. Well, the love of your life is about to walk through the door, and it's that guy. Yeah, I'm not falling in love with that guy. Right, right, right, because it's going to be that guy. Mmm, I don't know. The blue blazer's just, like, not doing it for me, so Yeah, yeah. You're right, 'cause here he comes. It's that guy! Oh, Robin. You should at least give her a chance. You know, make out with h a little, see if there's something there. Okay, I'm going to work. Yeah, you are. No, i'm actually going to work. Uh-huh. Go, work it. Mm-hmm. And the ironic part was Hi. Are you Robin? Yeah. I'm Don, your new co-host. That was the day she met Don. Damn it, Marshall. And Marshall had found the perfect turkey. Oh, baby, it is beautiful. It's 22 pounds. It's organic. You remember my bald Uncle Heinrek? It looks exactly like his head. Oh, my God. My turkey My turkey! So, when we showed up for the big day, Marshall was pretty bummed out. Well, we got the turkey. No. You didn't. You got the pathetic replacement turkey. Damn it, you know, why didn't I just listen to the prerecorded voice of former Mayor Ed Koch reminding me to take my belongings? No, Marshall, you don't understand. Marshall Eriksen is this your turkey? Yes! That's my turkey! Oh, come here, you handsome little bastard! Okay, I'm going to go put this in the oven. Okay. Oh, my God! You guys are the best friends ever! It was totally a team effort. I'm so ha Guys, I don't know what to say. I mean, it's Thanksgiving, but "thanks" just doesn't seem like enough. Come on, buddy, you would've done the same thing for us. Yeah, I would, and you know why? Because I love you guys. And I'm gonna show you just how much. Ted Mosby, Robin Scherbatsky, I bequeath unto you the fourth slap. Wait, what? Kids, you remember Barney and Marshall' "Slap Bet. " When Barney lost, Marshall won the right to slap Barney five times as hard as he could. So far, he'd used three of those five slaps. With the third being doled out exactly two years earlier on Thanksgiving Day 2007. A day that history came to know as "Slapsgiving. " Are you saying what we think you're saying? Probably not. Revenge Of The Slap," in which case, yes, that's exactly what I'm saying!  No way! Uh-uh. Slaps aren't transferable. Lily is the Slap Bet Commissioner. Lil? Slaps are transferable. No! Transferable! Wait, Marshall, you realize you'll only have one left after this. Are you sure you want to spend this slap today? Life is short. I figured, Slap-e Diem. the slap must occur before sundown, so as not to interfere with Lily's meal. Damn straight. Two, you guys have to decide amongst yourselves who gets to do it. Three we're going to tie Barney to this chair, which shall henceforth be referred to as The Slapping Throne. Sound fair? Totally. Amazing. Absolutely not! It was all set to be the best Thanksgiving ever. Until  Are we expecting somebody else? It was someone Lily hadn't seen or spoken to in three years. Dad. Now, Lily and her dad, Mickey, had always had a tough relationship. Mickey's dream was to invent the next great American board game. But his ideas were always a little off. Daddy? Yeah? You missed my ballet recital. Yes, sweetie, but, look! I just put the finishing touches on my new, hit board game, "Tijuana Slumlord. " Daddy? Uh-huh? You missed my gymnastics meet. How Long Can You Hold On?"  Here, Princess. Grab these. Daddy? Mm-hmm. I had a nightmare. Aw, sweetie. "There's A Clown Demon Under The Bed!"  Her whole life, Mickey disappointed Lily. And she always put up with it, until one day in 2006 when Lily went to visit her grandparents. So, Rita, are you excited about the, uh, the big move to Florida? Actually, dear, slight change of plans. We're staying here for the time being. We had a slight financial hiccup. Ma! The straw to my juice box broke! Ma, chop, chop! Oh, hey, guys. What a pleasant surprise. Dad, what happened to your apartment? Oh, well, I had a little falling out with my roommate. What happened? He wanted me to pay rent. Got kind of ugly. Dad! You should be paying rent, not living in your parents' basement. Hey, it's not my first choice. Having the old farts right upstairs is crimpin' my style a bit. Clearly, they're not getting the whole "sock on the doorknob" thing. Oh, they caught you with a girl? In a way. Bye, sweetheart. I'm off to work. Work? You're retired. Now that I have extra mouth to feed, I had to go back to the steel mill. "Dog Fight Promoter. " And then Lily gave her dad a look that Marshall had only seen a few times before. her "You're Dead To Me" look. Which brings us back to Thanksgiving of 2009. Hey, Princess. I brought "Diseases!" What is he doing here? I don't know, but maybe we should, uh, let him in and find out. No, I don't want to see him! Get rid of him! Hey, Mickey. Just hang tight, okay? We'll, well work this out. Take your time, amigo. I'm okays long as I have "Diseases!" The fun's infectious. God, I hope Lily's okay. Me, too. She doesn't talk about it much, but this thing with her dad causes her a lot of pain. Just tell me which one of you's gonna slap me! What? I'm dying over here! Ted reaches for a chip, I flinch! Robin fixes her hair, I flinch! I'm doing so much flinching. It's bad for my skin. I'm getting crow's feet. Crow's feet! Lily, come on. It's been three years, okay? That's long enough. Having him in my life causes me nothing but stress. It's just easier for him to be dead to me. Okay, Lily, look. I supported you when our neighbor, Mr. Sias, was "dead to you. " Hey! That's our newspaper. You'll get it back in 15 minutes. Make it 20. I had a steak last night. And I was fine when your bridesmaid, Whitney, was "dead to you. " Oh, Lily! You look so amazing! That dress is gorgeous! Oh, thanks, guys. Mm, I I'm just not a fan of strapless. I even understood when Mr. Park from the bodega downstairs was "dead to you. " One coffee, please. Oh, but only if you have decaf. I don't want to be up all night. Dollar fifty. Coffee, regular. Dollar fifty. Excuse me. Are you sure mine was decaf? You just used the same pot. Oh, I lie to him. Okay? Oh, okay. You son of a bitch. That was not decaf!  I supported you with all of those random people, but this is your father. Okay, can't we at least just give him some turkey? No. Come on, Lily. Please, I can't ask the guy to leave on Thanksgiving. Oh, you don't have to ask. Just tell him that it's really important that he be here. And before you know it, he'll be at a board game convention in Toledo, giving your braces money to some guy claiming to be Milton Bradley. He was just out trying to provide for the family. No. No, that's what my mom did by working two jobs. Marshall, that man broke my heart every single day for 20 years. Well, then we'll just give him some dark meat. No, seriously, Robin, you should get the slap. I mean, you're a great slapper. In fact, I want to study slapping under your tutelage. I want to be your slap-prentice. Don't sell yourself short there, Teddy. You're a slapping rock star. Your name should be Eric Slapton. Okay, okay, guys, this is torture. Just put me in the chair Slapping Throne. And get it over with! Ok, he's all yours. No-no-no-no. It's you, I insist. Okay, I'll do it. Great. Wait, what? I'm just saying, I'll slap him. What, so that's just, like, the end of the discussion? Well, you said I could slap him. Uh, I was just being nice. If anyone's gonna slap him, it's gonna be me. No, it's not. This is interesting. Lily, he's family, okay? And I'm sorry, but you just don't cut off family. Oh, well, that's easy for you to say when you come from the most ridiculously close family in the world. We are not ridiculously close. Really? Yeah. What about the Eriksen Family Dinner every single Sunday? Everything looks delicious, Mother Eriksen. Thank you, Papa Bear. Well, I would be happy to, Mother. Everyone, please join hands. Dear Lord I'm sorry, but that's weird. A family should be that close. And I want our future family to be that close. And that includes your dad. I can't believe you're taking his side. that man will never cross the threshold into this home, ever! It's just gonna be, like, five more minutes. Hopefully soon, amigo. I'm fighting a losing battle with hemorrhoids here. Oh, that's one of the diseases? No. Ted, there is an hour before the sun sets, at which point, neither one of us gets to slap Barney. So just let me have it. I'm the one who had the idea to call the Port Authority Lost and Found. Ooh, that's a good point. Rebuttal? I'm the one who slipped the guy a 20! Oh, philosophical conundrum. Idea versus execution. Please discuss at length. I carried that huge turkey all the way up here. I paid the cab fare. Well, you slept with one of my best friends! What?! You, you said you were okay with that. Well, I'm not! Well, why didn't you say something at the time? Because I'm still in love with you! Do you really want to slap Barney so bad that you would lie about being in love with me? I rely want to slap him, okay? Yes, your dad has made some mistakes in the past, but he's a different person now. He's moved out of your grandparents' house. He's got a job. He's paying off his IRS debts. Wait, how do you know all that? Like, body language. Okay, well, yeah, we met for a drink last week. I mis her a ton. Little princess. She ever talk about me? Yeah. Yeah, like, all the time. Um, she tells this one really sweet story about So never, huh? No, not a word. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can, we can fix this, right?  You know, I always thought it'd get fixed at the wedding. I even wrote a toast. But then, no invite. Hell, I haven't even seen a wedding photo. And then, right before my eyes, your father broke down crying. That's it! You're coming to Thanksgiving! You invited him?! The guy was, like, blabbering. What was I going to do? And then, some jerk at the next table called him a sissy, which I thought was totally uncalled-for. I can't believe you. Marshall, what gives you the right to do that? You and I are married. And that means he's my family, too. Mickey, come on in. Ted, you better roll quickly. Your gall bladder's about to burst. You know, Mickey, it's been, like, half an hour. I think we should go look for Lily. Eh, she just needs some time to cool down. Let's finish the game. Yeah, play another round. Best of seven! Damn it, Robin! I've known Barney the longest. I get to slap him. That slap is mine, Mosby. I've never slapped Barney above the waist. Look, I've wanted to slap Barney since the moment I met him! You don't think that I want to slap Barney? I've waited Wait, wait a minute. Wait a mute! This slap was supposed to be a wonderful thing, a gift, and look, it's turned us against each other. My God, you're right. This once pure fruit has turned into a poison slapple. You know what? Seriously, you take it. Are you sure? Slapsolutely. I really think that we should go look for Lily. Ted? Gall bladder about to pop. Okay, it's decided. Barney, come on. Get in the Throne. Hmm? Are you Yep. Come on. Well, you, um Uh, well, I guess that is the best decision, Robin. I mean men are stronger than women. D-Don't listen to him. Okay, it's been decided. Okay. And that's what you've always wanted, isn't it, Robin? A strong man to take care of you? I mean, sure. Growing up, you were a scrapper, Playing hockey with the boys, skinning your knees on the ice. But what you couldn't tell your teammates-- what you couldn't even tell yourself-- was that all you really wanted was that pretty white dress in that pretty white chapel. And at the end of the centre aisle, strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to do all your slapping for you. Let me at him! Robin! Come on! Hold on!  Oh! Oh, my God. What just happened? Sorry, Ted. Gallbladder burst. You move back three spaces. You come in here, and you watch your daughter leave and you don't even care. And now you've destroyed Thanksgiving dinner! Lily-Lily worked all day on this! Relax. It's not real bile. It's just lead-based paint from China. And horse bile. And at that moment, Marshall gave Mickey a look none of us has ever seen him give anyone. What's this? What's he doing? Did you swallow some of that paint? This is my "you're dead to me" look. Oh. Oh. Okay. Yeah, you know, Lily's is so much better Get out of my house! Hey. Mr. Park's, huh? This is the last place I expected to find you. Marshall Lily, I'm sorry. But just hear me out. I used to think that family was-was a right. But it's not. It's a privilege, and it has to be earned. I kicked your dad out. And I promise, baby, I will I will never make you see him again. Marshall, I came in here because it was cold and this was the only place that was open. I wasn't even gonna look Mr. Park in the eye. And then I found out Mr. Park died. Oh, my God. He really is dead to me. And if I feel this bad about never making up with Mr. Park, a guy who meant literally nothing to me  We got to go get my dad. Okay. So that's how on Thanksgiving 2009, your Aunt Lily performed a miracle. She brought a man back from the dead. Everyone. Before we get started, Barney, Were going to need you on The Slapping Throne. Slap Bet Commissioner, surely tying me to a chair is a breach Yeah, yeah, yeah. Less yappin', more slappin'. Ted, Robin. It's two minutes until sundown. Have you guys decided which one of you is going to get to slap Barney right in his face? It's gonna be Ted. What? Why me? Last year, you got left at the altar. You lost your job. But you've come such a long way since then. I'm so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in his face as hard as you can. Thanks. This is the worst. Mama! No, Robin. Look You just went through your own breakup, and while I know you and Barney left it on good terms, isn't there some part of you, deep down, that wants to slap him right in his face? There is. I know there is. This is basically hell on Earth. Oh All right. You got this. It hurts! No. I can't do it. I can't take this from you, Ted. Nor I, you. Oh, thank God. So, I'd like to make a gesture. Mickey? Oh, no way! I'm glad you and Lily are trying to work things out. So, to welcome you to our little family, I'd like to offer you this slap. Really? Well, I feel a little weird I-I just met Barney, But how often do you get a chance to slap someone right in his face?  Soft! I'm sorry. I can't do it. Oh, thank God. Lily I know I haven't been much of a father to you. You are kidding me. So for all the ballet recitals that I missed for all the art shows that I should've been at for the wedding gift that I never got a chance to give to you Princess I give this slap to you. Oh, Daddy! No. No, no, no, no. She is the Slap Bet Commissioner. She's supposed to remain impartial! Slap Bet Commissioner says it's okay. This is not good. Okay. Please, please, please. Let me Shh, shh, shh. Let me Just close your eyes. It'll be over soon. Running through a meadow. I can't do it. Why can't I do it? Because this slap has done exactly what I hoped. It's brought us all closer together. And it's caused us to recognize both the frailty and the greatness in ourselves and each other. Oh, give me a break. And that is why there will be no slap today. Oh, my God! This is the best Thanksgiving That's four! So, turkey? New from Aldrin Games Unlimited, it's Slap Bet! The slap-happy game that's a real hit. For kids of all ages. The way that you just got slapped. And it was on early. How early? Mike? wakey, wakey. But then, everything changed. Hey. Hey. See my show? Oh, I meant to watch it. I just got so busy with the whole "being sound asleep" thing. It took all night, eight hours down the drain. Oh, it's fine. After the broadcast Hi. Are you Robin? Yeah. I'm Don, your new co-host. Don was Don Frank, seasoned veteran of no fewer than 39 local morning news teams from all over the country. The guy was an industry legend. Oh. Wow! You are so going to hit that. No, I just think we're going to be great together on the air. And on the sofa and on the bed and on the coffee table. All right, all right. I'm gonna go up on the roof and stand there by myself for five minutes. Have fun. And that's exactly what she did. She just stood there. All right, kids, I'm gonna level with you. That's not what she did. Here's what she did. All right, all right. I'm going to go have a cigarette. I promised her I'd never tell you this, but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin did enjoy the occasional cigarette, and occasionally that occasional cigarette was more than just occasional. I just left something like this in my apartment. Robin, come on, take it to the roof. We said no smoking in the apartment after you torched the throw rug doing push-ups. All right, all right, all right. Geez. Yeah, Robin, I mean, God, not only is that a filthy habit, but also, can I bum one? Sure. What?! "How I Met Your Mother" Kids, your Uncle Marshall definitely doesn't want you to know this, but he also smoked off and on. It all started when he was 13, on a camping trip in Minnesota. Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate. It's summer vacation. Okay, but just one. This is my first and last cigarette ever. And that was the first of many, many "last cigarettes ever. " That's it. I am done, I am out. Last Cigarette ev-arrh! So, by that point, I'd heard it all before. Last cigarette ever. What are you doing? You haven't smoked in six months. Is this about the McRib? It's gone, dude, let it go. I'm worried about work, okay? They just hired a new head of the legal department, and he's going to be letting people go. So that's why you're worried? The new head of the legal department is Arthur Hobbes. As in "Artillery Arthur"? As in your former boss? Arthur Hobbes was the meanest boss Marshall or anyone else had ever had. The last time Marshall worked for him, it ended like this. I quit! Yikes. So does he hold it against you? Worse. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm, I'm Marshall Eriksen. Hmm. Um, we had a fairly intense screaming match. No. Wherein I suggested that you take your head and store it within yourself in a fashion that, while, while space-saving, might limit its exposure to, to sunshine. Well, that describes and everyone in my family except for my dog. He's such a good boy. Well I'll see you later, uh Randall Wilkerson. Marshall Eriksen. Gary Dinkersfield, right. Great, he doesn't remember you. Not great. Arthur Hobbes hating Marshall-- that's no big deal. He hates everyone. It's the people he doesn't know that he cuts loose. He just fired What's-His-Face. He fired What's- His-Face, Ted, and What's-His-Face was invaluable. Look, I can understand you getting upset, but it's not worth killing yourself over. Yeah, wait till you get laid off, then kill yourself. Like What's-His-Face. Although I guess now it's more like Where's-His-Face. Look, it was just two cigarettes. Okay, I can handle two. As long as I don't have three within 24 hours, then I'm not going to get hooked again. What's Lily going to say when she finds out you smoked? Lily's not going to find out. I have a system. Ah, yes, Marshall's system. Hey, Lil. You smoked. The next morning, your Aunt Robin was thrilled to be finally going on the air with a real pro. In three, two, one Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. And I am Don Frank. Two teens were arrested late last night for stealing a police cart. No, I'm sorry, not a police cart, a police car. Oh. Aw, screw it. Brain fart. Don't you hate those? Oh, look at that, the teleprompter's still running. Something about a woman giving birth on an uptown bus. Well, no point in jumping in halfway. I'll just wait till it's done. Uh and she cut the cord with a Metropass. We'll be right back. And we're clear. What the hell was that? Don, you said "brain fart. Back in five, four Well, let's do a great show for that half-drunk slob. Well, that half-drunk slob appreciates it. The next day, Marshall found himself craving a cigarette. It was driving him crazy, so he decided to get some fresh air. Oh, no. You're not up here to jump, are you? No, no, no, no. I fired a lot of people today. I don't need another jumper in my file. Oh, uh, cigarette? No, no, thank you. That's too bad. You know what I miss, Jeffrey? Getting to know somebody over a smoke. People are so interchangeable now, but you share a butt with somebody, you got a real bond. You know what? I will, I will take one. Okay. Thank you. I'm Marshall, by the way, it's Marshall, Marshall Eriksen. Yeah. Tell me something Marshall Eriksen. How would you like to see a picture of the cutest dog in the world? Hey. Yes, I smoked, and it was my third of the day. You know what that means? I'm a smoker now. It's all over. I even bought a pack on the way home and a lighter and a Vikings lamp, which has nothing to do with anything, but I saw it in the window and I liked it. Damn it, Marshall. We already have four Viking lamps and smoking kills. It was a way to bond with my boss, okay? You should have seen me up there. That is a cute dog. Yeah. Are those your kids? Yeah, yeah, whatever. Hey, oh, look what I got at the mall. Aw. There he is. There he is. Go ahead, you can pet him now. No. Yeah, yeah, come on, he likes it. Scratch him under the chin. I don't care what your reasons are. You know how I feel about smoking. Now, give me the cigarettes. And the lighter. Ah, that's the stuff. What?! What?! Oh, yeah, add your Aunt Lily to the list. Whenever Uncle Marshall fell off the wagon, your Aunt Lily got dragged right down with him. What you doing? If you must know, I am reaching out to City Hall to try to get the mayor on our show. Oh, my goodness, you are adorable, but the mayor's not coming on a show nobody watches. My colonoscopy had more viewers than this show. At least that had some twists and turns. You know, I don't, I don't know why you're acting like this. Maybe you're just bitter because you never had a shot at a network job, but I think I still do, so I really need to focus. I've been on a network. You were on a network? It was the best Labor Day weekend of my life. When you do the news, you're in these ergonomic chairs. It feels like you're sitting on a cloud. Which was nice 'cause it was right after my colonoscopy. And the dressing rooms? Oh. There's dressing rooms? Oh, you bet your sweet headset there's dressing rooms, Mike. No changing in the KFC bathroom across the street. No, sir. It was heaven. But the second you get used to it, they go find someone who isn't "going through a bitter divorce" and doesn't "reek of gin," and before you know it, you're stuck in a dead-end gig, surrounded by people going nowhere, doing the news in your tighty whities. Okay, the underwear thing was your choice, and I don't like that it's catching on. Ah, looking good, fellas. Feels good, right? God, I want to kill him. Of course people watch the show. You guys watch the show, that's, like, two right there. Oh, my God. You guys still haven't seen my show. What? We never miss it. We've seen it! Really? What color is the set? Uh Yeah, uh It's black. Right. Yeah. With, like, silver Uh-huh. Yeah. around the edges. Not your TV set, my show set. Ah Oh God, if I can't even get my best friends to watch, who's going to watch? Lots of people. Uh, you got bedridden insomniacs. Hmm. Bums camping outside a department store. People waiting in the ER, where the TV is in a cage, so you can't change the channel. Ooh, do you have any stalkers? Yeah, but even Leonard won't watch my show. I can't believe those guys are smoking out there. It's freezing out. Remember when you used to be able to smoke in bars? Oh, hey, dude. I think that hot girl over there's smiling at me. Uh, that's a chair. But yeah, dude, hit that. Guys? Marco! Polo! Polo! Well, it's dividing our group into smokers and non-smokers. And that's not healthy. You're right. Let's go have a smoke. What?! What?! Yeah, I'm not proud of it. Look at you two. Smokers. Just like the rest of us. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I am not a smoker. I only smoke in certain situations. Postcoital, when I'm with Germans-- sometimes those two overlap-- coital, birthdays, to annoy my mom, precoital, on a sailboat, the day the Mets are mathematically eliminated every year, and, of course-- wait for it, 'cause Lord knows I have-- pregnancy scares. Why are you smoking right now? I'm always precoital, Ted. You know, maybe smoking's not so bad. I mean, at least it gets us out in the fresh air. Yeah, and all the coughing really works my abs. But, as glamorous as it was, within a week, we all hit our breaking point. Actually, baby, my throat's a bit sore. So, I'm whapping him across the nose with the newspaper, right? Yeah. And my wife says, "Come on, you can't treat your son like that. " I don't know. Michael, call 911. Oh oh, my God. Okay, yes, yeah, right away. It's Marshall, by the way. Oh, my God. I hope Arthur's okay. Dibs on his office if he's not. We have to quit smoking. Honey, you said a mouthful. I wish I had never started. I mean, I think back to myself at 13 years old. If I could only go back to that moment I hate that little bastard. Me, too. Okay, that's it. Let's quit. Let's Let's do it. Well, I am proud of you guys. I have heard how difficult it is for smokers like yourself to quit, so, on behalf of nonsmokers, I salute you, and I am here to help. So, hand in your cigarettes, and I will get rid of them one at a time. You're quitting, dollface. I know I don't normally call you dollface, but it kind of works in this voice. Dollface. Hey, guys. Hey. Uh, I was just wondering, um, is anyone else interviewing the mayor tomorrow on TV, or is it just me? Hey, that's great. Whoa! Hey! Yeah, Don can suck it while I suck this. Light me, Marshall. Actually, um, we've decided that we're all quitting smoking. That's fantastic. I'm sick of you guys bumming my cigarettes. No, come on, Robin. We-we can't do it unless we all do it together. No. You can sleep with Marshall. Oh, God, Lily, no. Sorry, baby, you got to take one for the team. I-I don't want to sleep with Marshall. I've seen the looks. Right. I can't quit right now. Not before the biggest interview of my life. It's-it's too stressful. It's too stressful! Let's just have one more. Give me a cigarette!! No, wait! Robin, Robin, think about this for a second. Bloomberg is the antismoking mayor. Do you really want to show up to that interview smelling like smoke? It'd be like interviewing a vegetarian smelling like a McRib. Look, you're quitting. We're all quitting. Fine. I'll quit. Great. Great. We just have to get through the first 24 hours. After that, it's a cakewalk. Barney, do you have to bite your nails so loud? I'm not biting my nails. I'm trying to suck the leftover nicotine out of my fingertips. Marshall, can you pass the onion rings? What, you got dinosaur arms? They're right there. What do you think cigarettes are doing right now? You think they're thinking about us? Dude, if you don't stop tapping your foot, it's coming off. Oh, my God, Ted, I'm so sorry. All right. None of us knew what we were fighting about. We just knew we wanted to smoke. More than anything in the world. It wasn't going very well for Robin, either. Sorry I'm late. Someone used the microwave, and the elevator stopped. What are you doing? Okay, Don, Don, seriously, not tonight. Okay, I'm a little bit on edge because I quit smoking for my interview with the mayor, so just Oh, you precious little porcelain unicorn, you. Why would you do that? Why?! Because I care, Don. I-I care about the show, I-I care about my career. Unlike you, you unprofessional jerk! You're-You're sloppy, you're rude, and I wish you worked half as hard as the elastic on those stretched-out underpants. I'm starting to feel like this is getting a little personal. No, Don, it would be getting personal if I would say that the reason you bounce from market to market is because you're a loser-- a lazy, obnoxious, loser. The mayor canceled. In five, four, three, two Hi, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. You think I'm a loser? You're' right. I'm a loser. But at least I've accepted it. A plucky raccoon has been cheering up patients at a local senior center. I used to be just like that. Always wanting more and never getting it. It's a dead end, Robin. You're never going to be a network anchor. Just like you're never going to quit smoking. What are you doing? I'm enjoying a cigarette. Oh, that'll get you there. Oh, that's good. You want a drag? Can we be professionals? Please? Yeah. Yeah, professionals? You know who's working the camera right now? A chair. We're on a show where we can't even get the cameraman to watch. That's why the mayor canceled, Robin. And that's why Mike is on a fried chicken run. And that's why you and I can enjoy a cigarette right here on the air. No, thank you. Why? Because of our millions and millions of impressionable viewers? Okay If any impressionable viewers have a problem with this, please give us a call. The number's on the screen. Chirp, chirp? Chirp, chirp? Come on, Robin live a little. Oh, that must be Mike. He always forgets-- extra crispy. Hello? Robin, don't smoke that cigarette! Marshall?! We're all watching and we're all very impressionable. And I swear to God, if you smoke that cigarette, we're all going to smoke. We sure are, sweetheart, and you look fabulous. Oh, you guys. You don't have to do this, Robin. You don't have to smoke. Resist it, honey. Thanks for the call, guys. Oh, she did it! Good for her. We're not going to smoke. I have a pack stashed up on the roof. Uh-oh. I'm awake. And I'm smoking! Robin, you know how dangerous it is to wake a sleep smoker? It's fine. I bought a pack on my way home. Hey, great show, Robin. Yeah, but that Don guy, what a tool. Well, no, he actually apologized to me. No, I mean when he stood up. Those briefs were pretty revealing. You should date that guy. Yeah. Not in this lifetime. They were dating within two months. But more on that later. Hey, guys, look, the sun's coming up. You know what right now is a perfect time for? A last cigarette ever. No, I mean, a real last cigarette ever. Damn it, let's do it. Okay. All right. Last cigarette ever on, uh, on the count of three. One Two Three. I wish I could tell you this was anyone's last cigarette,but it wasn't. But we did eventually all quit smoking for real. Robin's last cigarette was in June 2013. Barney's last cigarette was in March 2017. Lily's last cigarette was the day she started trying to get pregnant. And Marshall's last cigarette was the day his son was born. And my last cigarette? Two weeks into dating your mother. And i'm almost back. I'm sorry I hit you, buddy. I wanted to make it up to you, by giving you this. Wow, she's hot! Yeah. Well some day, you're going to marry her. No way. We're pretty lucky. Totally. I'll be in my tent. Oh, no. Wait, hey! No, don't, don't do that. Well have fun for me. Oh, boy. What's in the box? What's in the box? What's in the box?! What's in the box?! Right? Brad pitt? Seven? Nothing? Yeah, I'm the jerk. What's in the box? Well, ever since marshall and lily got their own place, His mom keeps sending them boxes Of his old stuff she's trying to get rid of. Thanks, mom. You really nailed it this time. I really needed he-man's right arm And this old book of mad libs. "fart went to the fart to fart fartly. " That's nice. That's good stuff. That's good. Thanks, mom. Hello. Hello? - Ted mosby? - Yeah. The window is open. The what? The window is open. The window is open. What are you waiting for? - I - Run, ted, run! Lily, the window is open. Make a hole, people. Run, ted, run! - Ted? - Hey.

Everybody loved her. I think I know what we're dealing with here. Tell me when to stop. It wasn't that maggie was hot. She was She was the ultimate girl next door. She was the ultimate girl next door. Still is. I mean, every guy who meets maggie Falls madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I've known her, she's only been single For, like, three brief windows of opportunity. When she moved here and broke up With her college boyfriend, I waited a month. You know, so I wouldn't be the rebound guy. Well, the rebound guy lasted two years. After they broke up, I only waited a week. I was still too late. She dated that guy for three years. The next time, I wasn't messing around. I was at her door Not one hour after they broke up. The only thing she did Between becoming single And the moment I got there Was go downstairs and check her mail. I was still too late. And she dated that guy for four years. I wasn't going to let this happen again, So I begged her neighbor, mrs. Douglas, To call me the second she and david broke up. And now, a very single And available maggie wilks Is on her way to this very spot. I sent a cab with a female driver, so she'd have no other interaction with a man until she got to me. Where she will still have no interaction with a man. What up? I feel good tonight. Tonight's going to be good. Oh, hell, yeah! It's my overalls. I wore these babies all throughout high school. These were my jam. God, you really were a virgin Before you met lily, weren't you? Well, that's unnecessary. Oh, she's right, baby. If If you had worn these things in college, Even I wouldn't have slept with you. And, if you recall, I was good to go. No one, I mean no one. Could get laid wearing these. Challenge accepted. I, barney stinson, Being of sound mind and amazing body, Will wear these overalls until I have sex with a woman. I actually dated that guy. Okay. Quick game plan. Maggie shows up, couple minutes of hugs and hi's, And then everybody's out of here. This is my one shot. I am not gonna screw this up. Who'd you get to cover your class tonight? - Crap! - oh, my god!

One last piece of advice. Make adjustments Go get it energized! Hello? Ted, change of plans. You left her with Barney?! Ted, will you take it easy? I'm your bro. You're an animal. And even though our bro-lationship Has suffered its setbacks in this area, I assure you I will be the perfect gentleman. Oh, thanks. By the way, I really like those overalls. You have ten minutes to get down here or the window's closing. Because we're bros. While I was racing through the streets of New York, Trying to get back to the bar, Your aunt Robin was doing her best To keep Jim away from Maggie. Do you want to go back to the bar and see if Maggie's still there? Oh, no way! I love erotic dog photography. Did you see the one over there Of the corgies doing it people style? I'll get us a taxi. I just feel bad leaving Maggie all alone. No! Uh, let's have a glass of wine first. Oh, man. Oh, look how filthy I am. I am just a A filthy, filthy girl who would totally Go to second base with a guy as a favor to a friend. You like that? I'm going to call Maggie, see what she's doing. Oh, god! Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Give it a rest, jeez! She's hanging out with Ted tonight. Ted? What about David? They broke up. Maggie's single? That doesn't sound familiar. Can I help wipe that off? Please? I hate Barney. Stinson! Me, too! Lily finally got to GNB, But the place was deserted. Hey, baby. I thought you came here to quit your job. I forgot about the hoop. Yeah. I-I thought if I could just do one thing In that letter, I wouldn't feel like such an old sellout, So I came out here to dunk. Did it make you feel better? I barely grazed the bottom of the net, And now my legs hurt so bad, I can't even fall down. How could you?! Ted, I challenged myself To get laid wearing overalls. And if you stand in my way, then you're letting Barney win. And you don't want that. That smug son of a bitch will Never let us hear the end of it. Oh, thank god. Maggie - Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm going to have sex with her, then he's Going to tell her he's in love with her, and then you can do Whatever you want. Do we agree on the order? Mister! You missed just out on the night of your life. The night of your life. I've been in love with her for five years. I've been in love with her for 12 years. I've been in these overalls for an hour and a half. Maybe you can't dunk anymore. But you've achieved More in your 30 years than that You put yourself Through Columbia law school. You had the sense to chop off that stupid rat tail. And you married a smoking-hot chick Who looks nothing like your mother. I think that earns you An entire foot closer to dunking. There you go, vanilla thunder. Step back. Oh, baby. How about instead of dunking, we go up to your office, And you lie very still while I go bananas all over you? Could we maybe instead just do it right here? Sure, baby. We are dealing with a very small window of opportunity here. Guys, let me assure you, if you let me in there, That window's gonna open up again in, like, ten minutes. Wait, where's maggie? - She's gone. You guys were like vultures fighting over her. Let her be single for once. Maggie deserves some time to herself. Nobody likes to be alone, especially after a breakup, But that's when we discover who we really are And And what we really want. She deserves that. And kids, I meant that. Which is why I'm not proud of what happened next. It's around the corner. Around the corner. Hey. Maggie, sorry. Class ran a little Who's this? This is Adam. It's so crazy. We grew up next door to each other. God, we haven't seen each other since - A long time. And then Maggie Wilks told us The second-greatest love story I've ever heard. I just moved to town and I had to look her up. I guess we've got a lot of catching up to do. Yeah. Yeah, of course. So, kids, I missed out on the ultimate girl next door To the guy next door. See you next time. There was no "next time. " Maggie's window never opened again. Hey! Hey, I got it! That country bar, giddy-ups! The overalls have gotta work there. Wingman me? I don't want giddy-ups. I want that. I forgot what it feels like to chase the real thing, But I think I'm ready again. Yeah. Let me tell you where I'm at. I want to have sex with a girl So I can take off these overalls. Come on. Come on! Ted, you gotta help me! I gotta get these damn things off! Hey there. I just love your overalls. Dear 60-year-old Marshall. By now you should be working somewhere That's making the world a better place, Or at least trying to. No pressure, dude. I mean, sir. 29 P. M. So, someone sent back these chicken wings, Because they were too hot. And I'm like, "Too hot? Are you crazy?" So, free wings. Old man Marshall, As long as you're still married to Lily, You're doing just fine. Sir, this is on us. Sorry the wings were so hot. Oh, no, dear. It wasn't that they were too hot. It's just that I had wings earlier. Much earlier. "What's Barney been drinking? That girl was smoking hot!" Yes, I could've nailed her but no, it's not a failure 'cause there's one thing she is not. To score a ten would be just fine but I'd rather be dressed to the nines. It's a truth you can't refute. Nothing suits me like a suit! Verse 2 Picture a world where all the boys and girls are impeccably well dressed. That delivery guy in a jacket and tie, that puppy in double breast, that 80s dude with mutton chops, that baby with a lollipop, that lady cop who's kinda cute. Nothing suits 'em like a suit Barney and , wingman I can wear. , they're oh so debonair. , the perfect way to snare a girl with dady issues. in navy blue or black, check out this perfect rack. I want to give them a squeeze. Oh really? Then answer these questions if you please. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold? Suits. What would you say if you gave your suits away and in return you'd never grow old? Suits. What would you pick, one million chicks or a single three piece suit? It's moot. And what if world peace were within your reach- I'm gonna stop you right there. It's suits. Come on, Lily, get your head out of your ass. 2...3...4! Girls will go and girls will come but there's only one absolute. Every bro on the go needs to know that there's no accepted substitute. I'm sorry suits, let's make amends. My sunday best are my best friends. Send casual Friday down the laundry chute! 'Cause nothing suits the undisputed oft-saluted suitor of repute like a...wait for it... Barney and Suit. We're probably going to run into my students. They're going to corner me and want a free lecture. I don't even have my slide projector. damn it. Ted, I've been skee-ball champ here since law school. I have to pop in at least once a month To maintain my record. Whoa. Looks like you've been gone a while. Some guy named big fudge has been cleaning up. Yeah, he has. And you're big fudge. The biggest. Um, so by the way, I-I have to tell you something. Yeah. I, uh invited jenkins. Jenkins? No way! We'd all started hearing about jenkins A few weeks earlier. You guys will not believe what jenkins did this time. Who's jenkins? Oh, he's this hilarious New lawyer at marshall's office. Hilarious. Okay, so there's this jar Of maraschino cherries in the fridge at work. So, jenkins says, "200 bucks, I'll eat the whole jar. " So, we give jenkins Jenkins. And after that, the stories kept coming. So, the cfo comes in to sign some acquisition papers. So, jenkins goes, "Excuse me, mr. Wilcox. I think we forgot one of the documents. " Jenkins! So, we all go out for beers after work. Jenkins gets up on the bar and starts gyrating Like some sort of deranged stripper. Next thing you know, off comes the shirt! It was so gross. jenkins. Right? Well, it'll be great to finally meet the famous jenkins After all those stories. Yeah. And there's about to be one more story. I'm going to bang jenkins. What? You heard me. You-you want to have sex with jenkins? With jenkins, on jenkins, near jenkins. You name it. I want to wear jenkins like a sock. hey, guys. Ted, this is jenkins. Oh. Okay, this is going to sound crazy, But I thought jenkins was a guy. What? That's crazy! What gave you that idea? Oh, I don't know. Maybe the whole "Jenkins peed out the window of a cab" Story. Yeah. Much more impressive now, isn't it? Yeah. Okay, I'll come clean! It all started a few weeks ago. By the way, four eyes, new lawyer. This is jenkins. Watch out for this guy. He steals stuff. I don't steal stuff. And I don't wear glasses. I'm marshall. Hi, marshall. So, are you really a vikings fan or was he lying about that, too? Why? Is this a trap? Are you a packers fan? My wife knows I'm here. She doesn't have money, but what she does have Is a very special set of skills. I'm a vikings fan, too! I bleed purple and gold. I'm from pelican rapids. Pelican rapids? No way. Yeah. My grandpa lives in pelican rapids. Well, I mean, he's dead now, But he haunts a barn off route 108. whoa! Hold it, hold it. Dude, If you tell me you have a thing For a woman that is not your wife, I will drag you outside and kick your ass. Okay, first of all come on, buddy. You can't handle the fudge. Second of all, no. I think of her like a A big brother. Who, I guess, has boobs. But so does my oldest brother, marvin jr. Anyway, That night, I told lily about it. Jenkins. Aw. I can't wait to meet him. I should have corrected her. It would have been so easy. But I didn't, so, After that, whenever I talked about jenkins, I always avoided pronouns. So, the head of marketing comes in To choose people for the midwest audit. So, he goes, "Him, him, her, "Him, him Jenkins, him, her. " Look, I don't understand why you wouldn't just tell lily. Do you really think she'd be all that jealous? Ted, think about those stories I told you. Yeah, I could see how that'd be a problem. Exactly. That's why lily can't find out. Lily can't find out what? That marshall's going to buy her a horse. You are? That is so awesome! I love those things. Hey, guys, why Why is that kid over there staring at me? I think I know what this is. I think it has finally happened. I'm getting recognized fromy show. Oh, robin, that is so cute. But that's scotty. He's one of my students, and he's looking at me. Oh. How weird is it that I'm more famous than you? I'm on tv. Yeah, and I have 30 students in my class. That's what, Now, this will give scotty a little thrill-- Buying a drink for the old prof. All right, scotter, one question About neoclassical architecture, and that is it. You're robin scherbatsky, right? What? Yes, I am. Wow. Look, I-I didn't mean to stare. It's just, I watch your show all the time. Really? Really? Totally. What are you doing out with ted? Uh, it's professor mosby. We're friends. Holy crap! Robin scherbatsky is friends with my econ professor. It's architecture! All right, you know what, scotty? You're crowding us. Hit the bricks. Wait a minute. You're big fudge. Go! Hello? Hey, baby, I'm on my way up. What? Why? There was a measles outbreak at school, And they called a half day. Thought I'd come by here, have lunch, Maybe give you the measles. Okay. Um, I have a problem. That was my wife. When I first mentioned you, She mistakenly thought you were a guy, and so So, now you're worried that when she finds out I'm a woman, she's going to totally flip out. Yes. E-exactly. Oh, geez. Oh, gosh. Okay. Okay, I was in an improv group In pelican rapids. Follow my lead. Okay. Hey! Hey, baby. Mmm. Oh, oh, hi. I'm lily, marshall's wife. I am from the french embassy. I am here because of a small but significant Cheese incident that occurred She's jenkins! You're jenkins? Yeah, well, that, uh, camembert crisis Isn't going to resolve itself, So I'll catch you guys on the flip-flop. Marshall cringed. This was the moment he had feared. The famous jenkins! How about that? Funny, I was picturing a guy. Anywho, lunch? Wait. W-w-w-w-wait. So so, you're not jealous at all? I never have to worry about you with another woman. Right, because we're so hopelessly in love, right? Yeah, sure. Anywho, lunch? She wasn't jealous at all. Of course, she wasn't jealous. That's the whole dynamic of your relationship. What's that supposed to mean? Uh, it's like this, my man. Every good relationship has a reacher and a settler. Exactly. One person reaches For someone out of their league; The other one settles for someone below theirs. I did not settle for lily. Okay, yes, she's a little short, And-- true- my mom says she doesn't have The hips to birth an eriksen child, but Oh, my god, you guys think I'm the reacher. That's why lily's not jealous. The settler is never jealous of the reacher because, Where is the reacher going to go? The settler, lily, is the best thing That the reacher, marshall, is ever going to get. No. No okay. Yes, I am lucky to have lily, But lily is just as lucky to have me. Okay. Neither one of us is the reacher. Dude, you are so the reacher. You're getting her a horse! What? Shh. Take the hit. Take the hit. Thus ending modern architecture's Very brief experiment with the v-frame house. Excuse me a second. What are you doing here? I noticed you forgot something this morning, So I thought I'd bring it by. Your pen. This is your pen. And you chewed on the end of it. Recently. Ah, not a problem, ted. Your class was on my way to work. No, it's not. At come on, get up new york!, Where I'm an anchor, so I watch your show all the time. What?! You watch the show? Oh! Well, paint me flattered. Any other fans out there? Oh, we got oh. Okay, all right. Thanks for coming by, robin. Oh, well, tune in tonight. I am doing a great piece on snail poison. Also, Who's got the worst pizza in new york? I'll give you the answer after traffic On the ones, threes, fives and nines. Really? You guys watch her show? It's like watching a wel l-lit aquarium, But not as interesting. And now that I think about it, not as well lit. Well, the truth is, We watch it for the drinking game. The who now? Her morning show comes on so early, We're usually still at the bar, So whenever she does an interview, You have to drink every time she says, "But, um. . "" "But, um"? "But, um" Apparently, she says it a lot. It's funny. I had a drinking game based on robin, But it was actually on robin. I'd pour peach schnapps in her belly button Dude, we agreed we wouldn't do this. Sorry. You're right. She didn't like it anyway. Said it woke her up. Does she really say "But, um. . "" That much? That night, we found out just how much she said it. oh, that's great. nice. This wasn't your first Spelling bee, was it? Nope. Third. Oh, good for you. But, um But, um But, um but, um Hmm. Interesting article in the paper. Says that in every relationship, there's a reacher and a settler. Really? Let me see it. No, uh, it's not in this newspaper. It's in one I read a while back. This newspaper reminded me of the other newspaper. Anywho What do you think about that? Well, I guess sometimes that's the case. But not in ours. What? No, of course not. Right. Well, say-- gun to your head-- You had to say one of us was the reacher. Well, I'd say it's neither. That's what makes us great. Okay, now there's a gun to my head And our future children, and our future cat or monkey, Depending on who wins the game of risk We've been playing for three years. Nope. No reacher, no settler. Mmm. Mmm. Well, how about this? This went on for a while. Are you the reacher or the settler? And oprah's tried everything? Everything! You have to decide now. Well, I guess, if I had to say, Then maybe I'd say I'm the settler. How could you say that?! She thinks that she's the settler. I mean, that's it. I gotta-I gotta prove to her that I am not the reacher. I gotta make her jealous. Well, that's easy. Here's the plan. I'm gonna go get started on step two. Okay, okay, I got something. Remember the other night, the skee-ball game? When you were putting nothing but wood in the 50 hole? Whatever. Just another night for big fudge. You thought she was into me? Full-on lady wood. Yes. Of course. A plan taketh shape. If lady lily's jealousy Young marshall cannot budge, Then perchance, fair gentles, big fudge Can Make her jealous. Okay, let me try that again. If lady lily's I got it, buddy. I got it. Ted, I have got a great idea. Oh, is it "clean your hair "out of the shower drain when you're done"? Seriously, it's like you're trying to carpet the tub. If you wanted to print out one of your lectures or something, I could read it on air. Coming from a more entertaining source, Your students might actually pay attention and learn something. Oh, you're entertaining? Last night, there was three minutes of dead air While you sewed a button back on your sweater. Look, just because your class likes me more than you You're a drinking game! What? That's why they watch. They made a drinking game out of you. Every time you say "But, um"" They do a shot. "But, um"? Yeah. I don't say, "But, um" I've never said, "But, um" Well, then, I guess it's not a very good drinking game. Which would mean last night, when barney and I played it, I didn't get super wasted and throw up all over myself. Oh, wait, I did both of those things. So, face. Hey, jenkins. Hey, buddy. Hey, so, um, Lily and I are gonna go back to that college bar again. And, uh, we were wondering if maybe you wanted to come. Uh, you could just, like, watch me play skee-ball Or do exactly what you did the other night. Something like that. It's really up to you. I mean, I know that Hey, baby, what are you doing home? "Baby. " That's that's a name I don't deserve. What? Jenkins kissed me. She kissed me. The other day, she saw me play skee-ball, And I don't know, I guess She caught some of the big fudge fever. But you have to know I stopped it right away. And just, you're the only one for me, baby. Oh, I see what this is. This is about the whole reacher/settler thing. Come again for big fudge? You want to make me jealous, So you're making up a story about jenkins. I'm not making this up! This happened. That woman kissed me with tongue. Her-her tongue was in my mouth. Sure it was. It was thick and rough like a starfish arm. Oh, I'm so jealous. I'm just gonna go over there and punch her right in the nose. Give her a knuckle sandwich. Come on, baby. You want some soup? It happened! Do you have any Split pea left? These are just a few of the many contributions He made to architecture and yet He is only remembered for one thing. That my friends, is the sad legacy Of gregorio franchetti gazebo. Any questions? Hey, do you want to go out drinking with us tonight? What? Yeah, we're gonna play The robin scherbatsky drinking game. We were wondering if you wanted to join us. Well, what can I say except " But, ums up. " Can I still come? I'll pay. Nice. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, your third book was your breakout novel but, um But, um! Damn! Sorry. But-- just "But" No "Um, " Just "But. " Your first novel was written more quickly. That's correct. but, um! How great is this?! And it was right then that robin got an idea That would end the drinking game forever. I wanted to ask you about The novel you're writing right now. but, um! it's an idea you've had for a, but, um But, um! long time, but, um? But, um! No no, no, no. Don't drink, it's a trap! I think I'm gonna go. You can keep your ten bucks. Okay, but, um, thanks for being with us. But, um, if there's any college kids watching, But, um, but, um, but, um, but, um, but, um, We have to drink, professor. It's the rules. She said "But, um" But, um, but, um, but, um god help us all. Here you are. I'm so sorry I kissed you yesterday. That's okay. And I'm sorry I had sex with you in the mailroom. That wasn't me. Oh, good grief, that's two Awkward conversations I have to have today. I don't normally do that. I-I was really drunk. Yeah, I don't know how that happened. I thought snail pellets were safe, but, um But, um! I gotta get to work. Man, that game is really catching on. Damn it, how could I do this? It's okay. No, you know what, it's not okay. You're the nicest guy in this stupid office And I really don't want to screw up our friendship. This is so embarrassing. Please don't tell anyone. No, who am I gonna tell? Lily? I told lily. Oh, for pete's sake, well, I gotta go talk to her. I gotta apologize. No! No! Don't yes. Marshall, I'm just gonna tell her that it happened, That it meant nothing and that I'm sorry. No, I Yes. Yes. Do that. I will. Yeah, and if you don't have time for all that, Just tell her it happened, and that you're sorry. And if you're in a real rush, you don't even have to say, "I'm sorry"" Just tell her that it happened. That's the important part, that it actually happened. So emphasize that as much as you can. And so, lily, I guess What I'm saying is, it happened. I feel terrible about it, and I'm really sorry. Well it happened. What are you going to do? It happened. Terrible! But like I said It happened. Exactly, and I feel awful about it. And I'd hate myself if what I did Hurt you in any way or affected your relationship with marshall. Please forgive me. Kiss my husband?! My husband?! Nobody kisses My future baby daddy but me! Marshall, you're blocking the shot! Well, I And, kids, your uncle marshall Never tried to make lily jealous again. That's good. Okay, we're just going to have a nice, low-key class today. Not a lot of talking. No loud noises. 'sup guys? No, no, no, no. Please, just just go away. I just wanted to drop by and say Thanks for watching Come on, get up new york! Whoo! But, um! It'll just be a few more minutes, Mr. Stinson. Some people chew their nails. Some people tap their feet. And some people imagine they're being interviewed by renowned sportscaster Jim Nantz. Hello, friends. Every sport has had an icon who transcends the game. Boxing had Ali, basketball had Jordan, and the sport of sleeping with random hotties has my next guest, Mr. Barney Stinson. Barney, welcome. Thanks, Jim. Great to be back on the show. Good to have you with us. And, you know, the stats, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spanning six continents, and not a single fatty. It's impressive. Hey, uh, with all these accomplishments, though, there's one laurel that's always eluded you. Which brings us to last week. What was the story there? Buckle up, Jimbo, this one's a doozy. It all started when I decided to set myself a little challenge. Oh, my God. Whoa. He's calling his shot. Whatever girl I'm pointing to right now, that's who I'm going home with tonight. And Play ball! Hey. Hey. How'd the date with Dale go? You know, sometimes, that guy with the horn-rimmed glasses and the Smurfs T-shirt is just being ironic. Sometimes, he is a dork with a lazy eye and a love-hate relationship with Gargamel. Robin, just because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character on a first date doesn't mean he's not husband material. Sasquatch isn't fictional. That was quick. So, night one was pretty routine. Jim, there is nothing routine about the way I get down. Respect. Take us to night two. See that hottie over there nursing a Black Russian? She's about to chase that with a white American. Up top! You know if you're not careful, you're going to lose me. You guys, what should I say when Dale calls for a second date? How do you know he's going to call?  You're cute, Marshall. But I think Mama knows when a dude's digging the show. I mean, he couldn't keep his good eye off me. Well, let him down easy. People are fragile. And sometimes, without even meaning to, you might rip someone's beating heart out and stomp on it in a room full of 26 people and a teacher's assistant. How did school go today, Ted? Something bad happened. It was the first class of the new semester Jamie Adamic. Hi. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz? Hi. Well done. Adding a fake name to the sign-up sheet. That's, uh that's real original, guys. You know, I'd expect inspired minds such as yours to be a little more mature, and frankly, more creative. I mean, seriously. What kind of a fake name is Cook Pu? Here. Come on, guys. It's got to at least sound real. Cook Pu? Here. Whatever happened to the classics? Right, you know? Seymour Butts. Hugh Gerection. Here. Cook Pu! She's back here, bro. All right, come on, let me have it. Bring on all the Cook Pu jokes. Oh, we're not going to make jokes, Ted. I mean, that girl must be really down in the dumps. You really smeared the Pu name. Wow, back-to-back nights. Barney is on fire. That girl's lucky. Barney was the best sex I ever had. He's the best friend I've ever had. He's everything I want Marshall to be. He's everything I wish I could be. I'm just assuming that's what they say when I'm not around. I buy it. You're awesome. Now, night three. Paint us a word picture. Jim, I could tell I was on a roll, so I decided to mix things up a little bit. I think I'm going to go small boobs tonight. You're disgusting. Lily, they're people, too. Here's your burgers. Oh, thank you. Thanks. What, you're not sharing? You two always share a burger. No, we don't. We're not like weirdos who share everything. Uh, yeah, you are. That's exactly what you are. We're perfectly normal! Guys, what's going on? You know how Lily and I have been looking for new couple friends ever since we lost Robin and Barney, and Ted and Stella, and Ted and Robin, and Ted and Victoria? Geez, Ted, when are you going to get your life together? How did we end up here? We went on a great double date last night. It we were cool. We were casual. We didn't spaz out. And then, one tiny little detail came out and the whole night was ruined. Ruined!  And Joanna's toothbrush flips off the side of the sink, hits the ceiling and falls right into the toilet. Come on. That's That's crazy. Last week, the same thing happened to our toothbrush. Our toothbrush? Yeah. Super weird. Marshall, four out of five dentists just threw up in their mouths. Hey, check it out. Barney's leaving with another girl. Wow. Three girls in three nights. That's gross, even for Barney. Don't say it! You'll jinx it. Jinx what? I was on my way toward a perfect week. The perfect week. Seven nights, seven girls, zero rejections. Incredible. I mean, it's really like the sexual equivalent of baseball's perfect game, but even rarer. Yeah. Uh, the only player in history to have ever achieved both was Mustache Pete Drexell back in 1896. Now, this wasn't the first time you'd come close to a perfect week. You learned the hard way, though- one mistake, and it's all over. Sometimes, a teammate makes an error. Sometimes, one wild pitch You, me, the canned food aisle in the bodega next door. leads to a walk. And sometimes, you just lose focus. And that almost always leads to a hit. But this week, you were three for three with no sign of slowing down. I could do no wrong. Wish I could say the same for my friends. Cook didn't show up for class today. I'm sorry. Cook? Yeah, Ted, we know, like, a ton of people named Cook. Yeah. Cook Pu. Uh-oh, here we go. The dreaded Dale call. Oh. It's my mom. She's going through some pretty major league health stuff. Wait a minute. You want him to call? No! Shut up. Yeah. When did you guys even start doing that anyway? Like, years ago. You should know. We lived with you. Uh, yeah, but you always kept your toothbrush in the bedroom. Also weird, by the way. No. We kept it in the bathroom. No, there was only one toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine. Wait. Are you saying that, for eight years, all three of you shared one toothbrush? Oh, my God. Kill me. Kill me! I love this so much. So, you're through four nights. You're over the hump. Nice, Jim. Hey, I try. I'm no you. But then came night five, and with it, trouble. Beer here. Hey. Hey. How's, uh how's Barney doing tonight? Cool as a cucumber. Just like he's been all week. Yeah? That's hard to believe. Why? Apparently, this big merger fell through last week and Barney's being blamed for it. Oh, that's weird. He hasn't said anything. Look, I work with the guy. I didn't find out until this afternoon, when I walked by his boss's office. you cost this company, Stinson?! I'd never seen Barney look that scared. I I think he's going to get fired. I can't believe Barney might get fired. Yeah, they're having a meeting on Friday to determine whether or not he keeps his job. Poor guy. He must be freaking out. Yeah, I'm going to go talk to him. No! You can't distract a man in the middle of a you-know-what. Oh, come on, this is his career. This is much more important than some stupid perfect Ah! O- Okay. You can lick my hand as long as you want. I'm not going to let you ruin his Ow! Guys, we need to talk to him. I'll go. He needs a bro. Hey, buddy. Hey. Everything all right? Absolutely. Sure. Top of the world. Who am I kidding? I need your help. Anything, buddy. What is it?  Which one of these girls looks the dumbest? All right, kid. Let's check the scouting report. What about the heater? High and outside? All right. I'd go with the slider. Thanks, Skip. Yep. So, what did he say? Hmm? Oh! Yeah, he's going to take a swat at the Hamburglar over there. You were supposed to talk to him about losing his job. Cook Pu. Dale call yet? Why do you got to Guys, guys, guys, look! Barney, I'm going to stop you for a second. There's something I have to ask. Have you ever used performance-enhancing drugs? No, sir. I respect the game too much. Although, I can't say I haven't been offered. Dude, it was pretty awesome. You should try it. I have, I have some more. No, thanks. You sure? All right, suit yourself. 00. I need to go to the hospital. I'd never touch the stuff. You can test me if you want, Jim Nantz. Barney, I trust you. I regret I even asked you the question. Okay, let's go to night six. Two girls away from perfection. Hey! Hey. Dude, what are you doing here? Get down to the bar! Ted, relax. I'm already six for six. Really? Yeah. I was lunching at Tavern on the Green, I started chatting up this Swedish supermodel. Next thing you know, I'm playing a day game in the back of a horse-drawn carriage. Giddy-what-up?!  Awesome. What really happened? I had lunch at a Staten Island Chili's and banged a drunk hairdresser. Are you happy, Truthy McGee? Barney, we know you might get fired. Wait, you have to talk about this. You are just using meaningless sex to distract yourself from a really serious issue. It is not meaningless, okay? Number five and I really connected. She's going back to school. Or has a kid in school- something about school! So, today one of my students told me Cook is dropping my class. Oh, my God, Pu dropped out? She is flushing her education down the toilet! Any word from Dale? It's only been five days, he's gonna call! Why do you care anyway? You said he was a total dork. Do not talk about Dale that way, okay? He is twice the man you will ever be! God forbid, if you can't find another job, sell your place. Marshall and I have an extra room. You can stay there as long as you need. Make sure you bring your own toothbrush. Lily, what are you doing? Talking to my friend who's going through a really tough time. He's doing fine. Trying to sleep with seven women in seven nights is not "doing fine" it's a cry for help. Barney's whole life is a cry for help. But you don't mess with a man when he's in the middle of a perf What? Perfect week?  Unbelievable. You know, there's two things you don't do. you don't open an e-mail from Phil Simms in front of your kids. you don't jinx a man going for a perfect week. I don't know what to tell you. Lily's always messing with me. I think she has a thing for the Barnacle. You're a keen observer of the human condition, Jim Nantz. I can't believe you jinxed him. He doesn't stand a chance out there. If I ruined everything, why is Barney totally hitting it off with Third Martini Girl over there? Oh, my God! He's going to do it! Yeah. See? There is no such thing as a jinx. Tell me she didn't say, "There's no such thing as a jinx. " Wish I could. You were about to achieve something so beautiful! Well, well, thanks to her, the only thing that could ruin a surefire hookup was about to walk through that door. A member of the 2009 World Champion New York Yankees. Lily, I'm getting my own toothbrush. Well, I guess that's it. Barney's streak ends at six. What?! Why?! Because that guy with the weird hair just walked in? That's Nick Swisher. He's a New York Yankee. No normal guy in New York City can compete with a Yankee. And it doesn't even have to be a current Yankee. When I first moved here, I was on a fourth date with a girl I really liked, until I got rack-jacked by Phil Rizzuto. I was there. Holy cow, that guy had game. Mm-hmm. I'm not seeing it. Okay, let me try to Canada this up for you, eh? How would you react if one of those Ca-chuck guys with the skates and the sticks walked in here? Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks walked in here, my panties would drop so hard, there'd be a hole in the floor halfway to China. That's what it's like with the Yankees. Well, Barney's screwed. It's happening! Look. Hey! Want to come over and look at my snow globe collection? Snow globe collection? He's throwing junk out there. That is Nick Swisher!  Good effort. Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game. Not good enough. This whole week was a waste. And tomorrow, I'm going to get fired. I'm really sorry, dude. But for what it's worth, this week wasn't a waste. We were all having a really horrible week and you took our minds off it. Yeah, I had my first student drop my class- it sucked. I met my soul mate and he never called me back. I mean yet. He will. He will. We scared off a really great couple just because we share a toothbrush. You share a toothbrush?! Well, them and Ted. Wha? Wait a second. When we were dating, you borrowed that toothbrush all the time. Oh, my God. They take your mind off your troubles, if only for a moment. And deep down, we all needed that perfect week. The second she sits down next to Swisher, it's all over. Aldrin's got a bead on her! She's running out of room. She dives, and  I have no idea where she's going with this. Oh, my God, are-are you okay? Yeah. Oh. Sorry. I'm such a klutz! Oh, thanks. Ow! Oh, I think I twisted my ankle. Can you get me some ice? Of course. Oh, my God, she did it! I guess- I guess there is no such thing as a jinx! Oh, I'll get you some ice, Lily. Damn it. Swisher's back in play! Swisher's back in play! Follow me. Hey, Nick Swisher! This guy and his wife share a toothbrush! So? So, that's weird, right? Actually, I think it's kind of sweet. In a way, aren't we all trying to find that special someone to share a toothbrush with? Excuse me. Lily, Nick Swisher thinks we're sweet. Martini? We're having a beer with a New York Yankee. How cool is that? It's amazing. I totally follow baseball. Mookie Wilson, is that a thing? Yeah, baseball, it's amazing. But I tell you one thing, it's no hockey. I live right upstairs. What do you say we go back to my place?  Wow, to be honest, I don't normally do that, but I feel a real connection here, seven- Christy. Please. I did it!  Amazing! Congratulations on your perfect week! Thanks, Jim. I couldn't have done it without my teammates. Hey, on to a new topic. Do you really think you might get fired today? Um, uh, Jim, I- I-I told you I don't want to talk about that. Barney, I'm a figment of your imagination, so apparently you do. Think about that. What a jerk. You're a jerk. Mr. Donovan will see you now. Stinson, we've reached a decision. We're keeping you on. I know this past week must have been tough on you. I barely slept. Here you go, guys. The official hat of Barney's perfect week. I was going to do shirts, but then you have to guess sizes. And feelings get hurt. It's a mess. In commemoration of Barney's induction into the Hall of Game, this tie, worn on the seventh night of his perfect week, is hereby retired. May Barney's heroic feat be remembered and spoken of for generations to come. I'm totally going to sit my kids down one day and tell them about the time Uncle Barney nailed seven chicks in a row. Am I a bad dad? Take out order for Cook Pu? We have a number two over here for Cook Pu. You guys got Wendy saying it now?! Come on, I- Okay, I get it. Cook Pu is a stupid name and it gets stupider and stupider the more you say it. Cook Pu. Cook Pu. Cook Pu. Here. Well, not all of us. Welcome back to Super Bowl XLIV in Miami. Get a load of that guy. You think that's his real number? Well, that explains where Barney is. Dibs on his wings. Hey, guys. Hey. Does anyone know who won the Super Bowl? You were there. It was the I won, because I am now in possession of a magic phone that always rings. And do you know who's always usually on the other end? A chick. So how many chicks do I have calling me now? Infinity. You guys remember Ranjit. Hello. Hey, Ranjit, good to see you. Hey. I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week, I will be sleeping with hundreds of women, and I don't want to take the subway, 'cause you know, germs. Wait, you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you? Oh, indubitably. I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes peeled for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic, and wants to 96 me. Semicolon, end parentheses. This ought to be good. I can only imagine the quality of girl that Oh, my God, you are the guy from the Super Bowl. Magic phone, guys, magic phone. Hey, guys, hey, Ranjit. How's it going? Hey. Hello. Hey. That beer looks a little flat. It's Scotch. Whoa. Something troubling you, kiddo?  Don. Don was Aunt Robin's co-host on her morning show. Now, even though her show was on so early that no one watched, Aunt Robin was a consummate professional, but Don was not. Oh, yeah. But that morning, Don had gone too far. Now, that's what I call having a "woof" over your head. Don. Don? Why is Ulee's Gold in every crossword? Oh, it's me? Sorry, sorry. Uh, next Sunday is Valentine's Day, and one lucky patient will be receiving a very special chocolate heart- a human heart. Oh, hey, that reminds me. I've been meaning to ask you. Robin, do you have any, uh, Valentine's Day plans? He asked you out? He asked me out. That's crazy. And they use "Ulee" because of the vowels. Ah. What did you say? Well, we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said okay. Robin, you are going to marry this guy so freaking hard. Right in the butt. What?! No, I hate Don, and now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air. What would your viewer think? Whoa, whoa, whoa, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans. What, getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan? I did not say it was a good plan. Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now, and it is getting interesting. Look at these texts. Read this one. Yowza! Now, look at this one. Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now, look at this one. Or this one or this one or this one. Okay, okay, okay, buddy, how, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts. I can't do that, Ted. I just can't hook up with a girl if there is a hotter girl out there with whom up can be hooked. Isn't there always a hotter girl? I know. Isn't it wonderful? Go for Barney. Cut to the chase-- what's your cup size? Oh, hi, Mom. There's always a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options- you got Internet dating, you got bars Holding up your phone number on national TV. I never had that problem. When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage, and I love my wife more and more every day. Hmm. It is true. It's, it's very rare that two people just meet and fall madly in love, like Robin and Don. Oh, we-we're not even, like, going out for dinner. We're just hanging out at his place. Ooh No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people. Oh. Oh. Whoo Wait, Robin, what exactly did Don say when he asked you out? I'm having some friends over at my place for a little party. You should come by if you want. Uh Okay. Robin, Don didn't ask you out. Uh, of course he asked me out. Uh, no, he didn't. Yes, he did. He did. He did-- he did! Okay. Well, dog my cats. I think I know what's going on here. Robin, did you want Don to ask you out? What?!  No, I hate Don. I-I can't stop thinking about how much I hate him. It's like, it's like all the time. I just want to attack him and rip his stupid clothes off and just spank him with his little paddle until his bum's all red. Shut up! See? That right there is what free will gets you-- constant, ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman, and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arranged marriage me. Or this one or this one or this one. You want us to arrange your marriage? Absolutely. Look, there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked I'm good at. Ladies love Teddy West Side. You're waiting for me to comment on your self-assigned nickname. All right, well, here's my comment. I love it. Really? Teddy West Side, continue. It's the picking I suck at. I pick the wrong girls, but you guys-- you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other. Aw-- well, with a slight assist from the Wesleyan Housing Department. And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir. Get out there, find me a girl. We'll double-date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her if she's cool with it, and she will be 'cause I'll wear my nice blazer. I love that blazer almost as much as Robin loves Don. I do not love Don. Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart. You know what it's like? Wait. I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds! Okay, this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit. You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit, but then one day you look at it and you realize-- wait a second-- it's a duck. Hmm. It's a rabbit, it's a duck. Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. It sure was. Well, relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him. You thought, "This guy is a duck," but one of these days, you're going to realize, "This is actually something that I love. He's a rabbit. Whoa. I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate. What? Yeah, I gotta agree; ducks up, rabbits down. Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits. Ducks are Ducks are. . Rabbits are adorable! Ducks are, like Have you ever been in a fight with a duck? I mean, ducks are jerks! This led to one of the most intense arguments our group has ever had. Fine! I concede! You win! Say it. You have to say it. rabbits are bad. Yes! Yes! Yes! It feels so good! Yes. Thank you. And Don is-- and always will be-- a rabbit. Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin. Think about it. Don? Donald? Donald Duck? And what, I wonder, does Donald Duck never wear? Pants. Pants. Don's a duck. Permission to say "lawyered"? I'll allow it. Lawyered. Yes, kids, sometimes there's a fine line between love and hate. There is no place I would rather be and no one I'd rather be with. I should get that. Go for Barney. Look, I'm sort of in the middle of someone-- something right now, and I You're a hot lady bullfighter? You gotta go. MacLaren's Pub. MacLaren's Pub. Well, hello There is no place I would rather be and no one I would rather be  Would you excuse me for one moment? Go for Barney. Look, I You're a gold medalist Japanese figure skater? Adios, muchacha! MacLaren's Pub! MacLaren's Pub. No place I'd rather be, no one I'd rather  Oh, for Pete's sake! You're a hot chick? Sayonara! MacLaren's Pub! MacLaren's Pub! Well, hello I realize that you're very busy, so I'll just get straight to the point. Okay. Shakah!  And that's my bad leg. Very bad. Are you okay? Yeah, of course. Why, uh Why wouldn't I be?  Oh. Go for Barney. Barney had been sure that phone was something he loved, but now, he realized it wasn't that at all. It was something else entirely. I'm free. Ah, now this feels right. There is no place I would rather be. And no one I would rather be  Uh, what's wrong? Did you hear that? Hear what? Shh, shh, shh, shh. Go for Barney. And then Valentine's Day arrived-- the deadline for Marshall and Lily to find me a wife. An important job they had, well, forgotten to do. Aren't we supposed to go on a double date with Ted. Ted? No. He's not seeing anyone. Yeah. Remember he asked us to find a Oh, no. Hey. Hey. Want to get married?  I don't know what kind of architect! Houses, buildings, that kind of crap. Want to marry my friend Ted? Want to marry my friend Ted? Want to marry my friend Ted? What, you can be choosy? You're in a bar on Valentine's Day, huh? Hey, just real quick Aah! You want to marry my friend Ted? Man, Ted's right. It's tough out there. This is stupid. You know what? We forgot about this. I'm sure Ted did, also. âTª Here comes the groom âTª âTª In his favorite blazer âTª âTª Gonna meet my wife and I âTª Blazer, Tazer. Hey, Ted? Yeah? Before you go meet your future wife, come to Don's party with me. That's what you're wearing? Yeah. Why? He's a duck. That dude be straight duckin'. âTª And I think that I'll amaze her. So we went to Don's party. Look, Robin, I don't want to crowd you on your little date here, so if things start to get hot and heavy with you and Don They're not gonna get hot and I'm just saying, if they do, I'll just say, "Well, I got a dinner rez," and then Wait. This is the best part. I've been working on this for a while. Hmm. I'll duck out. Ha, ha, ha. Okay, it's not gonna happen. But, yeah, do that. Mm-hmm. Hello, Robin. Oh! Well, I got a dinner rez. Oh! Oh, God, Don, what the hell are you doing?! I don't know. It's something called The Naked Man. I read about it on some guy's blog. My God, I'm so stupid. Why did I ever think it would work on someone like you? Yeah, 'cause I would never Could, like standards, so, you know. I-I thought this was a party. I only said that to get you to come over here. I didn't think you'd bring a date. Ted's not my date. He's a friend. Oh, God. You probably think I'm some kind of playboy now, right? You could say that. So he's a rabbit. At least you know for sure. Ted, this may hurt a little. I'm recycling your old Architecture Weekly Magazines. What are you doing? Cleaning. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day. Oh, thank God you're here. Yeah, I've been thinking. Um, maybe we should call this whole thing off. No! Ted, we got her. What? We got her. It's, it's the craziest thing. We were searching all week, and then, a couple hours ago Trudy? Married. Blah, blah? Committed. Relationship? Bellevue. Natalie? Ted's her least favorite person in the world. Well, she's not getting any younger. Get rid of it! What? This phone is cursed. Cursed, I tell you! I try to ignore it, but it just never stops ringing! It's ruining my life! I should get that. No, please. Please! Please, Marshall, let me answer it. It could be an emergency. She could be trapped in a giant bra! Barney, Barney let it go to voice mail. Okay. We have to find Ted a wife. We're being too choosy. It almost doesn't matter who it is at this point. Okay. It's a phone girl? I know. I know, but no. Then we met her, and Ted, she's a world-class violinist, she's a gourmet cook, and she can quote every line from Caddyshack. Wow. Hello, Ted. So we all had dinner. And kids, Marshall and Lily's hard work had paid off, because that girl was terrific. In fact Oh, but Natalia, tell Ted the problem. Yeah, yeah, tell him, tell him! Well, unfortunately, I'm going to have to leave the country soon because my visa is about to expire. But when it came down to it And you, sir? The rabbit or the duck? What? It's a prix-fixe menu for Valentine's Day, and we're already out of steak, fish and chicken. So, rabbit or duck? Rabbit. Sorry, guys. I got to go. I need it back! Where's the phone? Well, hello. Oh, I met you already. Where's the phone?!  It's hidden. Where had Aunt Lily hidden the phone? Well, to answer that, we have to back up a little bit. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day. It's Barney's phone. I wonder how it got in there. Ted? Come on. Big date. Ah, what's the harm? Hello? And just like that, I was hooked. Terrific. I will see you there. And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer. Oh, I think you'll know the blazer when you see it. Ooh. I gotta go. Oh, thank God you're here. So rabbit or duck? Rabbit. Sorry, guys. I gotta go. Well, hello. Sorry, babe. I gotta take this. Barney's phone. Teddy West Side speaking. It's my phone! I am taking it back! And I'm taking your cool nickname, too! Barney West Side speaking. No! I love it so much! It just keeps ringing and ringing and ringing. Hey, baby. Give it to me. Come on. Stop. It's mine now. It's not your-- Lily. Ah!  No! Oops. Being single sucks. Mm. It turns you into a crazy person. I know. So much running around and freaking out, and for what? It's all so you can find someone you can sit on a couch and put off cleaning the bathroom with. Well, the joke's on the rest of the world, because we can do that on our own. Exactly. Exactly. Hmm. Robin, I-I have to apologize-- Just save it. Let's just do the news. No, listen. After you left the other night, I was embarrassed. Not because I was naked. I'm actually pretty okay with my body. Clearly. I got married in college. I just got divorced three months ago. I have no idea how to be single. But that's not why I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed about my behavior right here at Channel Um It starts with a one. I know that much. Uh Twelve. 12! Channel 12. I mean, just look at your mug. Right. Well, no. You look at this mug. You are a tremendous news anchor. And you deserve a c o-anchor who gives a crap. And from here on out, that's gonna be me. Well, I'll believe that when I see it. Well, you'll see it right now. I'll go get you some coffee. Don You're wearing pants. Well, look at that. Ah, duck. In this one, I'm just a jerk. Well, guys, tonight is the night. to see my antique camera collection. Ah! It's Ted's bait. "Bait"? A true gentleman invents a pretense to lure an honorable lady into his apartment. Some item of interest or beauty you can both pretend to admire for five minutes before she hops on your disco stick. Like she's coming up to "borrow a book" or "check out an album on vinyl. " Or to see your new rap poster. "Rap poster"? Who would that work on? It was the first week of college. I was really into Wu-Tang Clan. Yeah, bait is tricky. It has to be something interesting enough to get the girl upstairs, but not so interesting that it overpowers the night. I found that a slot machine was too fun. And a trampoline turned out to be too dangerous. a teacup pig. "A teacup pig"? Who's that working on? You have a teacup pig?! I didn't know you had a teacup pig! Can we see the teacup pig?! Hey, can I borrow your teacup pig? Yes, you can borrow my teacup pig. You have a teacup pig?! Oh, my gosh! I can't believe you have a teacup pig! You're just so cute! Yes, you are the cutest piggy ever! What? Were you always this pretty? Or are you going to give me that whole, "Oh, in high school I was really shy and awkward" line? I was shy and awkward. I was, like, a hundred pounds heavier and I had these crazy buck teeth. Seriously? No, I've always been hot. What are you going to do?  Do you know who else would love this teacup pig? Hmm? My boyfriend. You have a boyfriend? Ugh, I know. So annoying, right? I mean, he's not really my boyfriend. Oh, good. I mean, technically, he kind of is. Well, is he or isn't he? Some of both, but definitely not either. Are you getting any of this? Look, I really like you. I just need you to be patient. I don't want to lose you, Big Brown Eyes. Yup. Somebody doesn't want to lose Big Brown Eyes. Oh, Ted. She's got you on the hook. What? What? I'm not on the hook. Oh, you are totally on the hook. She's stringing you along. She's not committing to you, but she's keeping you around just in case, like an old can of chili in the pantry. Um, who's buying canned chili and not eating it immediately? Amen, sister. Ted, don't feel bad. We've all been there. I've been on both sides of it. I've been a hookey and a hooker. Move past it, guys. I've been a little bit loose, but money never changed hands. I've been on the hook. Lisa Walker. So I was, like, thinking, Lisa- do you maybe want to, like, go out with me? That sounds great. But I'm sort of seeing this guy. He's got a LeBaron convertible and an "in" at the roller rink, so I'd hate to burn that bridge. I understand. But how about this? You can be my secret boyfriend who does all my homework for me. A'ight. You want to see my rap poster? Poster whore. Anyway Lisa Walker strung me along for months until one night, I went to go tell her how much I loved her. Aww. Hmm. Ugh. In song. She wasn't home yet, so I waited. And waited. I woke up four hours later, covered in snow. And that's when I saw it. Lisa's footsteps. She had walked right over me and into the house. It was the best thing that could have happened. It got me off her hook. Okay, that is definitely not what's going on with me and Tiffany. Listen to this. I'm really into you. I just can't be with you right now. Huh?! Huh?! Ted, "right no" is the classic on-the-hook catchphrase. Yup. "Right now" paints a picture of some sort of magical future time when everything will work out, but the truth is, that will never happen. It's like this. "I can't be with you. " Boom! "Right now. Yeah. I think my high school boyfriend, Scooter, is still sort of on the hook for me. Sort of? He totally is. The poor guy showed up at our wedding hoping to win you back. Yeah. It's still sometimes weird when I see him at work. Wait. What? Scooter works in the school cafeteria. We've talked about this. Hey, Lily. Nice dress. Tater-tots?  We most certainly have not talked about this! Yes, we have. I've mentioned it tons of times. "Lunch Lady Scooter. " I thought that you were referring to some sort of long overdue device that carries around those poor, underappreciated lunch ladies! This explains a lot. Lunch Lady Scooter was there again today. Oh, yeah? Did you jump on that thing? Give it a ride? No! Really? If it were me, I'd be riding that scooter all day long until I broke that thang in half. So those poor women still have to walk everywhere? Wait. Scooter is working at your school?! Are you jealous? No, I just feel bad for Scooter. 'Cause the only reason he took that job is he thinks he has a shot with you. You have to make it clear that he doesn't, so that he can move on and a real lunch lady can get her job back. Damn! I've tried. Hey, Lily. I saw you had seventh period free. So do I. You want to run away together? Let me be clear, Scooter. There is no way you and I can ever be together. Right now. I'll see you tomorrow, Lily. It's Tijuana Tuesday. "Right now"? You right-now'd Scooter? You need to let Scooter off the hook once and for all. You're right. Day after tomorrow, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Why not tomorrow? Baby, I can't ruin Tijuana Tuesday. Really? You're really going to sit here all night watching the door because Tiffany said she'll "try to stop by"? Barney, I'm not going to just give up on her. I should have given up on her. This girl is special. She was the devil. Things are going to work out with Tiffany. No, they're not, dumbass. this girl is a poison and you need to cut her out of your life forever. Hey, there she is. Oh, she brought some of her coworkers. Hang on to this girl, Ted. Hang on to her and never let go! these are some of the hottest girls I've ever seen. And they all work with Tiffany? Yup. There could only be one explanation for this. Ted is Tiffany a ph-ph-ph pharmaceutical sales rep? Yeah, how did you know that? And you never thought to mention that? What? It's just a job. Just a j just a jah Ted, throughout time there has always been one cutting-edge profession to which hot girls, like Tiffany, have flocked. Shall I walk you through the history? I'm gonna explicitly say no. Man was a hunter. So, the hottest profession of the day? Gatherer. Homo erectus indeed. As man mastered technology, the hottest profession of the day evolved. I'm pretty sure it's a hernia. Can you check again? And then, man took to the skies. And so, hot women put on high heels and became stewardesses. I am in the upright and locked position. And then man said, "Life is hard. I should start taking lotsf prescription drugs. " And so, hot girls rolled into doctors' offices, looking sexy enough to render the very erection pills they peddled ironically redundant. So now, pharma girls are today's hottest profession. Hey, Big Brown Eyes. How you doing? I'm good. Hey, by the way, you, uh, you ditch that loser boyfriend yet? No, sir. Touched my nose. Dude, ditch Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a pharma girl free-for-all. Side effects may include loss of clothing, rug burn, shortness of breath and sore abdominals the next morning. What in the world is up?! Hey. So I know that you've been having trouble letting Scooter off the hook. Well, I decided what you need is practice. Now, you say the problem is his cute, sad eyes? Well Aww! All right, shut it, woman. Now, I want you to look at this teacup pig and tell him that there's no way that you could ever be with him. Teacup Pig, there is no way I can ever be with you. Right now. Oh, come on! Grow a pair! I'm sorry, but he's just so freakin' cute. I just want to cuddle him all day long. Yes, I do. You know that's funny. I remember when you used to say things like that about me. Oh, I still do. Yeah, not as much, Lily. Not as much. Ain't no party like a pharma girl party 'Cause a pharma girl party don't stop! Dude, I have already hooked up with three of them. Fantasmo. Plus, my cholesterol is down. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I've never felt more alive- oh. Guys, great news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. Proof that I am not on the hook. Oh, you're still on the hook. Ah, uh-uh, listen to how we spent last night. First, we cuddled. Then, we shared chocolate cake. Then, well, I don't usually join in on locker room talk, but I gave her a pretty sensual foot rub. it didn't go any further than that. Well, no, but And tell me, did you by any chance make that chocolate cake? It was a mix. Dude. There's no shame in admitting it, Ted. We've all been on people's hooks and we've all kept someone on the hook. Um, I most certainly have not. What?! Are you joking? What about that girl from the university library? Um, Henrietta? Henrietta and I are just friends. Oh, she is so on your hook. Absolutely not. She totally was. I mean we cuddled. We shared chocolate cake. She gave me foot rubs- long ones. I'm not proud, kids. it's a nice little ego boost. No wonder you're such an expert about keeping people on the hook. What about that poor camera guy you work with? Mike and I are just friends. Come on. Mmm Oh, yeah, that's the stuff. Robin, have you ever thought about taking us to the next level? Well, if you're talking about doing my laundry, I'm on board. You got yourself a deal. Hmm. What?! I- I am not keeping Mike on the hook. You are Captain Hook. Dude, I'm a girl. Okayour girl parts are like a spiderweb. Sometimes you're gonna catch stuff you don't want. That doesn't make it okay. Oh, a-and Henrietta is in, in no way wasting her time with you, right? Henrietta knows that we're just friends. In fact, I'm gonna call her up and hang out with her tonight as friends. Hey, Ted. Hey. I love you. What? Uh, do you want a foot massage? 'Cause I've been practicing on myself. No, I'm good. I didn't know if you were hungry, so I just threw together some it's not a big deal. Kids, looking back, I don't know how I didn't see that Henrietta was madly in love with me. Oh. Hello. Hey, Ted. Hey, Tiffany. I'm going out of town this weekend for my friend's wedding. Want to be my date? I would love to. Hey, what are you doing right now? Oh, God, no. Awesome. Okay, I'll see you in, like, ten minutes? Great. Soy, Henrietta, something came up. Take a rain check, pal? Yeah, it's no problem. All right, yeah, hey-ho. Oh, you're strong. What a jerk. Henrietta, I Wait. Where did Ted go? I thought we were finally going to get to meet him. Yeah, something came up, okay, Mom? I told you there was no Ted. I heard that. an out-of-town wedding. It was finally happening. Champagne? Ted, oh, my gosh, I forgot to call you. Well, whatever it is you wanted to talk about, we can talk about it now. This is Jack. He's the best man at the wedding. We just got back together. You know, now that I think about it, a phone call would have been nice. You're Ted? Ouch. But I hear you make a mean chocolate cake. Oh, isn't he great? And he's in a band. Thanks. Come on, Lily. You have to get Scooter off the hook. Now, try again. Teacup Pig, oh I don't want to be with you. Right now. Man up! Teacup Pig I don't want to be with you. Ever. Finish him! We will never be together in any sort of sexual way ever again. Nice. Sort of a weird thing to say to a pig. It felt really wrong. Anyway, I just don't think you and I are going to work. Right now. And that's when it hit me. I was on the hook. I also realized I missed this so much, baby. Tiffany was on this guy's hook. It was a vicious cycle. Henrietta was on my hook. And years later, I found out this poor bastard was on Henrietta's hook. You know what? We're not going to work ever. I'm done. And it's really better for the circulation if you knead the arches with your thumbs. Now, I'm done. Marshall, I can do this by myself. Okay, well, then prove it. And, um Grab me a pudding. Listen up, Scooter. There is no way you and I will ever be together. Right now! Marshall! I'm sorry, but he's adorable. Listen. I don't want to be with you. Right now. Hang in there, Scoots! I'm not going to live forever. Last night I was with this pharma girl who was so hot, you should call a doctor if you don't have an erection for more than four hours. Am I right, people? Yeah, there's no people- just the girl you most recently dated. Hey, Barney. I want you to meet the newest pharma girl. Oh. Gladys Reynolds. Nice to make your acquaintance. I represent statins and other cholesterol-lowering drugs. Come on, girl. Let's go get our drink on. It's over. What's over? Pharma girls are no longer exclusively hot chicks. It's the en. You're being a little dramatic. Am I? It starts out with a Gladys. Next thing you know, a few not-so-fabulous gay guys enter the ranks. And before you know it, pharma girls look like the crew on a Southwest flight from Albuquerque to Little Rock. It's over! So that night, I went straight to Henrietta's- all set to let her off the hook. This is Jack. He's the best man at the wedding. I'm done. Yes! The answer is yes! No. Oh, it gets worse. It's perfect! Mom, Dad! Ted proposed! Oh, my God! I knew this day would come!  Son! Yeah, well, there's been a No. What did you do? I seriously considered just marrying her out of sheer awkwardness. But I did what I had to do. I did what anyone keeping someone on the hook should do. I broke her heart. Henrietta, I'm sorry if this is blunt, but I think I owe you this. I don't want to be with you. Right now? Ever. But we're still getting married, right? It was brutal. Oh, I'm sorry, buddy. Honesty is tough, but in the end, it is the far kinder alternative. Yeah. Hey, sweetie. Hey, Mike. I have to tell you something. Wait. Did you finish my delicates? Got one more load. Ah, it can wait. I Hey. Hey, how's it going? Still in mourning over the end of the pharma girl era? No. I realized that their reign had to end to make room for some new hot girl profession. Maybe it'll be intergalactic communications officer on a rocket ship to some distant solar system we can't possibly imagine. Maybe it'll be meter maids. We just don't know. But one thing is sure. The future glows like a giant sun shooting amber rays of light into our hearts and minds. Wow, uh, what changed your mind? The realization that hope springs eternal, Robin. That and this little bottle of purple pills I found in my couch cushion. Don't know what they are, but they are amazing! Loves it. It's my birthday! So it's a good thing she married Marshall. It's still my birthday! Because he loves planning birthdays. Feliz cumplea�os, baby. The theme of this today's birthday breakfast in bed is "Spanish Interlude" And How on Earth did we end up in the lyrical rolling hills of Northern Spain? Baby, tonight is going to be so much fun. Just the five of us, black-tie dinner, and Ted is picking up your favorite cognac pumpkin cheesecake from Edgar's. Okay, I am off to run your super secret birthday errand. And I'm taking this guy with me because I don't like how he's looking at you. A new camera! Thank you, Marshall. I took some naked pictures of myself before I wrapped it. Put a bow on it. There wasn't a bow on it. Wrong "it. " Thank you, honey. I'm going to get some great shots of our little group with. leather bound, acid free paper, adorable handwritten captions. And most importantly, the group shot. Cute photo, right, kids? What you don't see is what happened ten seconds before this picture was taken. I want to get the perfect group shot. Marshall, sit between Barney and Robin. Why? You know, light, color, balance, aperture You're just saying camera words. Wait, you don't want Barney and me to look like a couple in this picture, do you? Of course I don't! You two aren't going to last! - I'm going for timeless here. Totally true, we're running on fumes here, but still rude. We hated Lily's group shots. Okay, maybe I get a little bossy, but I just want to remember those times. Like tonight. I can't imagine a better birthday than, than being here with just my four best friends. And Ted's here now. Happy birthday! This is Amanda. And Amanda , Ted, you were supposed to bring a cheesecake, but instead you brought two grocery bags and a woman we've never seen before. Hi. I'm Marshall. Welcome to our home. Start talking. Amanda's going to make Lily a cake. She's a chef. We met when I was at a restaurant last week and I sent some soup back. Lucky, she's got such pretty hair I didn't mind eating a little bit of it. They call me "The Shedder" at work. I'm so glad you're making my birthday cake! In honor of Lily's 32nd birthday, I've got a lot of great games planned, starting with "Lil-ial Pursuit. " Okay, who's got number one? I do. Of course you do. Okay, Amanda goes first. to answer as many questions as possible. What is Lily's favorite color? Well, she's wearing pink, so I'm going to say pink. That's Robin. Her favorite color is elbow. I believe Ted was mouthing the word "yellow. " Which also would have been wrong. This game is called "Gilding The Lily. " - Nice. You've all written down your favorite things about the birthday girl. And Lilypad, you guess who wrote what. "Lily makes everyone in her life, from her friends to her students" She's a kindergarten teacher that's what he means by that. " feel loved. She makes the best oatmeal raisin cookies ever, can recite every line from Goonies" She saw Goonies in the theater right after her parents separated. After that, she had real trouble trusting people "She's the strongest person I've ever met. "I can't imagine my life without her. I love you, Lily. " Of course it was me. That's so sweet. Lily, you try to guess who wrote this. "You seem really nice. " I'm going to guess Amanda. That was me. And I meant every word. Well, I should get back to that cake. Let me know if you need anything. Quick! Let's do the photo! Everybody around the fireplace. Hang on, I'll let Amanda know. That's okay. She's busy in the kitchen. Let's not bother her. Come on. Hang on a second. You You don't want Amanda in the photo. It's just, you know, auto-focus, shutter speed, zoom Lily, what's going on? Who wants a party hat? Look, I'm a bird! Let's all be birds. Tell me the truth. Of course not. I'm not going to let another one of your dumb skanks ruin my precious memories. Lily, what are you talking about? Ted, you always do this. You bring girls that we barely know to all our big group events. Or, we could just keep on a-strolling down Best Birthday Ever Avenue. Do I get a vote? Skank Lane! Skank Lane! Guys, I've composed a song for the evening. Follow along. Happy, happy Lily day! Christmas morning, four years ago. Our first Christmas together, just the five of us. Here's another fun little trivia game. It's called Name That Bitch. It is San Wrong. You're thinking of Santa, 'cause it was Christmas. Fun fact, each year, my mother has Easter tea with her friend Bunny. Not that fun. I remember her name. It's Sarah. Close. It's Leilani. She just had to come to Christmas because you said, "Guys, she might be the one. " And she's not the only "might be the one. " New Year's Eve, 2007. Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and "She's the One" Emily. Robin's Uncle Cecil's funeral. Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and "this just proves you find the one when you're not looking" Isabel. My appendix surgery. Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and Well, this one you admitted you were just trying to bang. Respect. Remember this yoga instructor you brought to my last birthday? you! Thanks. You won't believe who just came in. Don't look! Why aren't you looking? It's Slash from Guns N' Roses! Group shot! And we got it. We got a picture with Slash on my birthday. Awesome, right? We know how this ends. Wrong! You know what's funny about it? He was grabbing my ass. How many hands does he have? No wonder he's such a good guitarist. I'm sorry dude, I thought that you were Lily. Wait, look at these pictures again. Barney has the same pose in each shot and these are, like, years apart. Yes, about that, I never take a bad picture. Never have, never will. There has to be a bad picture of you. Not one. The elementary school? Everyone has bad pictures from school. Not the Barnacle. I always look drop dead, stone cold amazing. Unlike Marshall, who just looks dead, stoned and cold. He was right, kids. Marshall does a lot of things well, but he does not take a good picture. They're not all bad, okay? Like Here, look at this one. My eyes are open. You did put a bow on it. Chip and dip? Sure. Got it! A bad picture. Is it though? Wait! You were eating a chip! Where's the chip? It is physically impossible for me to take a bad picture. I don't know why. Ask God. I'm sorry about Amanda. I'm going to say it. You are being a birthday brat. You're all bent out of shape just 'cause you think I ruined a couple pictures. These girls have ruined so many events, or are you forgetting Paris? What happened in Paris? It was junior year and I was studying abroad in Paris, and I hadn't seen Marshall for two months. Two months. And I had just started having sex. I wasn't ready to stop for two months. And Marshall was coming to visit over spring break. And at the last minute, Ted decided to come with the girl he had just gotten back together with, Karen. Karen. I am so excited you're here. I'm so excited to go to Paris. I'm so excited to have sex again. But just before the plane took off Wait, I want to tell you something. Really? 'Cause I think I want to tell you the same thing. Is your thing, I had sex with my philosophy professor last night? 'Cause that's my thing. And thus began the longest seven and a half hours of Marshall's life. I need to sleep in your room this week. Marshall can bunk with Ted. Two months! My balls were bleu! Bleu! This will come as no shock, but the rest of the trip was terrible. And all I wanted was a romantic kiss picture in front of the Eiffel Tower, which I actually did get. It just happened to be between Karen and Francois, our waiter from the day before. Wow, that's just awful. Just Oopsies! I dropped my phone. Smile, you son of a bitch! Got it! Did you, though? Wait. How do you do that? You weren't even standing up! The camera loves me, Robin. More than loves me. The camera lusts after me. The camera wants to put on some nice lingerie, pop in an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I lie there with my eyes closed. I'm sorry about Paris and all the ruined group shots, but when you're single, you got to hope that each next new girl is the one. Irene. And Sarah. Or Isabel. It's Leilani. What is wrong with you? At the time, yes, I thought each of these girls could be the one, but I got to stay hopeful. What's the alternative? Here's the alternative. How about no more random skanks at my birthday! Hey, sweetie! Do you guys have a cooling rack? Drawer under the oven. Can't wait. You're just the best! Ted, I'm sorry. I gonna have to agree with Lily on this. These kind of events are hard for a new person. That's why I didn't bring Don tonight. When I lived in Japan, this guy, for our third date, brought me to his brother's wedding. Now, I a total stranger, am in that Japanese couple's wedding picture for all eternity. Yeah, Ted, I think you should listen to Robin. Right, right, 'cause 'cause Robin's your best friend. It's a trap. And before she was your best friend, what was she? Oh, that's right. One of my random skanks. Yes, Ted. This particular skank happened to work out, but she's the skanky exception, - not the skanky rule. Hey, guys, that about wraps up this whole skank conversation. Let's get back to the birthday song! Barney, your part goes like this. She's cute. She's cute. She's cute. I bring girls to these events because you guys are important to me. You're my family. Your part goes like this. And nice. And nice. And also nice! Yes. We're a family. So why can't these events ever just be us? Like the time we celebrated Marshall passing the bar exam. Hey, guys. This is the disgusting, smelly hippie I'm dating. I did not say that! You might as well have. Hey, guys. This is Strawberry. Should we order more food? No, Strawberry's not eating. I'm a vegetarian. Let's all raise a glass. For the last three years, Marshall has been working so hard, and I am so proud of you. Meat is murder! I admit it. Strawberry was a mistake. How could I have known that going in? Her name was Strawberry. If it's a big deal, Amanda doesn't have to be in the photo. But I promise she's not gonna ruin your birthday. Just give her a chance. See, look, guys. We're all friends again! Now let's work on those harmonies. Happy happy Lily day! Happy happy Lily day All done. I hope you like it. "Happy 42nd birthday, " Lori. " Kids, you know how I've told you about Lily's "you're dead to me" look. That expression she gets just before she explodes in white-hot rage? Well, this wasn't it. But this was Marshall's. "42nd"? Does this hot piece of ass look 42 to you? Or! Or does she look like her name is Lori? - No, Marshall, it's okay. Ted, get this stranger out of my house! I am so sorry. Out! Happy, happy Lily day. Happy, happy Lily day Well Amanda refused to come back. She thinks you guys hate her. Marshall, you have to go apologize. You ruin Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? If anything, you should apologize to me. What are you talking about? Ted, you bring girls to these intimate events it makes them think that things are serious. And then when you break up with them, you know who they turn to? Me. I've been your girlfriend cleanup crew for years. February, 2005. I had just come back from a marathon study session at the law library. Hey, Natalie, where's, where's Ted? We broke up again! Won't you sit with me for a little while? Just sit? Man, you know what? I've been up for, like, 36 hours. Just for a few minutes. And at first, I was completely sympathetic. But damn it, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical. You know what? I'm going to go get us some Rocky Road, and we're just going to sit here and talk it out until it makes sense. I just thought we had something so special, you know? Me, too. Yeah. But, you know, life goes on, sweetheart. I don't know how I'm going to put my life back together after this. Oh, shut up. I'm sorry my search for true love has been such an inconvenience to you guys. You know what? Maybe your precious pictures would look a lot better if I wasn't in them. Look better if Marshall weren't in them. Cheap shot. Cheap shot. You know what these pictures are, Lily? They're a big, fat lie. They're posed. They're touched up. They're what you want our life to be, not what it is. Halloween, two years ago. You got in a fight 'cause you didn't want to dress up as penguins. It's not just that she didn't want to. It's that she called penguins "lame. " Penguins. And yet, here you are, smiling like nothing's wrong, completely phony. Robin's birthday, three years ago. Robin had a cold and you made her change out of her pajama's for the picture. And then you pinched my cheeks to get some color in them. Yeah, but you look pretty. And then, we all ate chocolate cake in my bed. Yeah, I guess it was. Hey, look at this one. This is the first picture the three of us ever took together. That's right. It was. Yeah, you remember how it happened? Okay, ready? Wait. What pose should we do? Buddy cop picture? What about, '80s sitcom about two roommates who never agree on anything? Nice. Okay, one, two Hi, Marshall. Ready for the movie? Yeah. Just a second though, okay? We're about to make history. We're about to take our first ever roommate picture. Why don't you get in the picture, too? Really? What you doing, Ted? - What if we break up? - What if you don't? Come on. I forgot all about that. Marshall and I had just been dating a few weeks and you invited me into the picture. I liked you. It's my turn to believe in you. For all I know, she's the one. Thanks, Lil. I think Lori's age has made her very wise. They say your forties are when you really get to know yourself. So, your Aunt Lily called Amanda. All right, people, gather around. Let's make a memory. Okay, Marshall. Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second, and when I say so, open them. Birth a? Bertha? No, it was my birthday. Your brain makes associations in a very obvious way. All right, people. Gather around. Let's make a memory. What's in this dip you made? 'Cause it tastes like cilantro. And you know that cilantro makes me Yes! Let's hear the story. From the beginning. It all started a week ago. I was making time at the local watering hole. Enter a dame. Nothing sexier than a man in a fine cravat. Except for a woman who appreciates a fine cravat. How about we just call it a tie? A cravat is a kind of tie. When I get in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, lust and a singular hunger to satisfy my lover's every carnal need. Good thing the cleaning lady is coming tomorrow. Well, good night. What? Wait, what? I thought your body was going to become a machine fueled by desire, lust and a singular hunger to satisfy my every carnal need. I really think that Don and I are hitting our stride as a news team. All credit goes to this lady on my left. That story you did on which rodents to avoid on the subway The answer may surprise you. It's all of them. I got to run. I'll see you. It's good to meet you. That guy is awesome. He's funny, he's smart, he's handsome. Scoop him up before someone else does. I hope you're not talking about you. It has been four months since you broke up with Barney. Maybe it's time to put yourself back out there. Exactly. Barney's dating again, and he couldn't be happier. I couldn't be more unhappy. All night long, she's hot and heavy for me. I get her back to my place, and she just bolts? I mean, at least, when I run out on a girl, I have the common courtesy to sleep with her first. It's called manners. She read that book Of Course You're Still Single, Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut. It's this book that helps single girls find a husband. It's Robin's copy. I leafed through it a little bit. Fine. When you were with this girl, did she subtly slip the word "sex" into conversation? I'm in the inter-sex-tion, and I only have a couple of sex before the light changes. I mean, everyone's honking at me, and it totally sex, but I can't turn around because a jogger slipped and fell in horse sex-crement. Go on. Go on. Did she make excuses to establish physical contact with you? Is this cashmere? Cashmere? This is hand-spun virgin merino. The fibers in this suit are less than 12 microns thick. I love a tiny fiber. Well, you're in luck, because mine's the tiniest. And the more you touch it, the softer it gets. She did that, too. Here is the final test. Next time you see her, ask her out for the following night. "I can't do anything tomorrow night. "I've already made plans to clean my garbage disposal "and treat myself to a bubble bath. "But how about next week sometime?" You're trying that Of Course You're Still Single, Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut crap on me. It's not crap. It is a brillant book! It scares away guys who are only interested in getting laid. Why not just say you have a kid? You'd be surprised how many jerks there are out there. That's why the book says never sleep on the first date. no sex until after 17 dates. If you're not going to take her out on 17 dates, you should just give it up. She is gonna give it up, not me. Because, thanks to Ted's book That's Robin's. I can stay two steps ahead of her at all times. There's a loophole in here somewhere and I'm going to find it. Listen you wanna go out Saturday night? - Saturday night - Is he asking you out? Say yes! It's really sweet of you to ask, and you're a great guy - I will go out with you. That's probably what you're hearing. But Saturday night sounds great. We can even go to a steak house, and you can bring home some prime rib for my friend. Gotta go. Love you. Bye. What the hell are you thinking? You've got to do this, okay? A great guy like Don is rare. And speaking of rare, prime rib! Don't forget. Thank you. I don't believe it. This is her! She wrote the book. Her name must be Anita. My plan was to sleep with her, but this changes everything. I'm going to sleep with her. Boy, this girl that Barney's going after, she kind of sounds like the anti-Barney. I love how the universe decided to bring those two together. Actually, Anita's going after Barney because I told her to. Wait, you sicced Anita on Barney? - How do you even know her? - She was on my show. But, um, if you had to summarize your book in 30 words or less I'll summarize it in one word. That word is "no. " By saying no constantly and consistently, you empower yourself while simultaneously turning any jerk into a submissive, sniveling, puddle of a man. And isn't that every girl's dream? After the break, we're going to talk about your new book, Of Course You Don't Have a Retirement Plan Yet, Take a Look at Yourself, You Dumb Slut, due out in June. We'll be right back. We're clear. You? What about you? You dating anyone? Dating's not really my bag right now. Somebody broke your heart? And then, I told her everything. It just came pouring out. And by the end of it This Barney needs to be taught a lesson. You say the word, and I will destroy him. This Pilates instructor was off the charts. Picture Robin, but younger. And bigger boobs. Maybe not bigger, but more shapely. And bigger. I get her up against the StairMaster, and we - Do it. I know, it was stupid, but you have to understand, back then, I was really upset about the breakup. I was going though my mourning period. There was a lot of scotch and a lot of long nights at the shooting range. I hope those weren't the same nights. It's not like I remember all of them. Did you know that Robin was going through a mourning period? - She seemed fine after the breakup. She keeps her emotions to herself. But yeah, I caught her crying a couple times. She cried? Like, real tears? But that means And then, Marshall realized what a jackass he had been to Robin. Exactly. Barney's dating again, and he couldn't be happier. I mean, that guy has been active. Sexually. He's been You know? It's like How could you let me do that? You're supposed to stop me from embarrassing myself in public. I know, but that song's kind of catchy. Damn it. I've read that thing cover to cover, and I can't find a loophole. What am I going to do? Well, there is one other option, but you're not ready. Tell me. If you have to seal the deal in one date, it's got to be one doozy of a date, right? I'm not talking dinner and a movie. I'm not talking mini-golf. I'm talking wrapped up into one incredible night. I'm talking about a superdate. A superdate? That sounds kind of lame. What if we call it a megadate? If you want my help, it's a superdate. Gooey and romantic? Gooey and romantic? You don't have to take her To Paris or Peru. Ted, what are you doing? You just have to make her understand Ted, people are looking at us. What she means to you. God, really? You're going to do this right now? On your superdate, Troubles of the world will simply have to wait. For wonders and amazement served upon a silver plate, hurry up now, don't be late. 'Cause hand in hand you'll find a land where paradise awaits. And then boom! Fireworks over the Manhattan skyline! You kiss her. And that's your superdate. That sounds gooey and romantic. Finally, the night of the big dates arrived. So, tonight's the big night. Where's the D-bag taking you? That's not a good nickname for Don. What do you mean you - What's wrong? - Robin canceled her date. What? She was totally psyched for it like an hour ago. You look like the classiest, most expensive prostitute ever. Thank you. I take it you're excited to go out with Don? You know what? I kinda am. Don't tell Marshall. I won't. I bet you'll have a nice time tonight. Not, however, a super time. A super time will be had by Barney on his date with Anita. Carriage ride, dinner at Le Tombeur des Culottes. They're calling it a superdate, so How could you do that?! Robin just got over her mourning period! She seemed so happy after the breakup. So unobservant. Such a guy. She was obviously crushed. Wait, but that would mean And then I realized what a jackass I'd been to Robin. Whatcha singing? Just a ditty I wrote about girls Barney's been banging lately. God. Where is she? I think she's in the restroom. Guys, I'm fine. Dude. Why would you do that? Because I'm angry at you. I'm angry at me. I'm angry at Ted. And frankly, I'm still angry at the Empire. Why are you angry at me? Dude, you've been a real jerk in front of Robin while she's been have her mourning period. She hasn't been going through any mourning period. Barney, sit down, you need to hear some stuff. Take a look at yourself, you dumb slut. And then Aunt Lily told Barney every excruciating detail of what he hadn't been seeing. You should've seen this girl. I'm leaving. So we get up to my place I can't believe Robin's been upset. I can't believe you threw up in your Stormtrooper helmet. I did something worse in it after The Phantom Menace premiere. So, she's been this way ever since we broke up? Actually, she was doing much better until you decided to go on this stupid superdate with Anita. And now she's off, sulking God knows where. I know where. Barney, what's up? Thought you were going on some big date. Robin, I know you're upset. What? I have I've never been happier. And this Anita sounds lovely. I am so glad that you two just randomly happened to find each other. It just warms my frickin' heart. So, you're not upset? Of course I'm upset, Barney. Don't you see how constantly talking about your conquests makes me feel like I'm just another number to you? But you're not that. You know, and now you're taking Anita, who you barely know, on this amazing date, when I never got treated that way. It just it just sucks, that's all. It just sucks. I knew I was bad at being a boyfriend, but I had no idea I'd be so much worse at being an ex-boyfriend. I'm sorry. What can I do? Nothing. You've already proven I'm not important. Stop that, I'm serious. Ask me for anything. Barney, of course you're going to sleep with her. Why else would you be taking her on this superdate? She's not going on the superdate, Robin. You are. Your Uncle Barney finally gave Aunt Robin the superdate she truly deserved. With a guy she truly deserved. Of course, there was still one loose end. I meant to call you. Well, I'm breaking all my rules coming down here, but nobody stands me up like that. So, are we going out or what? I'm sorry. I made a promise to a friend. I have to say no. I see. You're trying the "no" thing on me. You think that'll work? 'Cause it won't. How about this. I'll cut you a deal. Maybe you might get lucky after the 12th date. The 11th date. Fifth date. Tonight. Tonight before dinner. How about you? You interested? Come on, Barney. I'm sorry, Anita. The answer is no. Well, good. Because my answer is no, too. Here's my final offer. And that's my story. Well, here's a $500 ticket for jumping in the river. I hope it was worth it. I hope so, too. It's an old wives' tale. How did the big date go? Pretty well. Pretty pretty well. Like how "pretty well"? Guys, come on. It was fine. You know, it was nice. We had a good time. Let's just let's just leave it. Although, one interesting thing did happen. No, I meant do you want to move in on the couch so I can sit down. Yeah, that's what I meant too, - Like I said, just let me think about it. But, now that you mentioned it Do you wanna move in? So what did you say? - I'm considering it. Plus the guy is a loser with a dead end job. Yeah, I mean I I see how happy you are and as much as I love you as roommate, I want you to do what's right for you. Are you trying to kick me out because of the milk thing? It's really annoying. Robin? No I have a system. I put the empty carton back in the fridge to remind us to buy milk. Ok, why don't you leave a full carton to remind us we don't have to buy milk? Alright, alright. As your ex Before you jump in to anything, I need to meet this guy. I think it's kind of weird I haven't met him yet. Totally weird, it's almost like someone carefully orchestrated that way on purpose. Fine, but you have to promise to be on your best behavior. I promise. So I'm banging this Portuguese contortionist And I swear She is so flexible, at one point she was on top of me and underneath me On top and down low! - Who needs? Who needs? - I'm good. Well actually, I'm not sure that's true. Well, I think he's awesome. But I'd feel bad for any woman with a kinda low self esteem to actually date a guy like that. And that's when I realized Robin never told Don she had dated Barney. I like you, Don. We both love a good scotch, we both enjoy my compelling stories And we both dated Robin. Now he knew. So Barney's your ex and you still hang out with him? I gotta say I'm a little uncomfortable with that. Oh, don't be, it's like we never dated. Long story short, this exchange students arms gave out And we both fell  over sex swing. Seriously, I have never been able to find a girl who can do that position since Robin. Hey, Lily, Marshall, how was your weekend away or any other topic? - Awful. Twin beds? I can't sleep in separate beds. We should go complain. Yeah, you're right, I'm gonna march down there and demand another room. Yeah, I'll go with you and Just a sec House keeping! Could you come back a little later? We're taking a little cat nap. It's time to check out. We slept for 18 hours. Hey, Ted, you think it's weird that Robin is still friends with Barney? I think it's weird that we're all still friends with Barney. I just don't know how to feel about her hanging out with one of her exes all the time. And that's when I realized Robin had failed to tell Don about another one of her exes. Me. No, hanging out with one ex is fine, even 2 I'd give a pass. Hell, 2 might be even better than one. For some reason. Yeah, but if you were dating someone and he hung out with one of his exes Wait, I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Yes. Hey, guys, just wanna make sure Project Runway is recording. Did the Jets get new costumes? Well, I guess we won't be having creme brulee tonight, My browning torch is broken. You know, when I heard your roommate was a single guy, I was a little jealous, But now that I know that he's gay - I'm OK. He's following Cher on tour. Hey, don't get me wrong, Cher puts on a hell of a show. But I am not gay. Hey, Lily, be honest. Is it weird that Robin hangs out with one of her exes all the time? Well Ted and Robin broke up years ago. It's a non issue. You dated Ted, too? Robin, of the four people you consider your best friends in New York, - you've slept with 50 percent of them. Yes, but they're also your exes. And you live with one of them. Look, I'm sorry. I gotta, I gotta think about all this, My God! She's 1000 degrees. It's like putting my leg against a tail pipe. Ow! He's toe nails are like daggers. I'd love a sandwich. But no eating in bed. Stupid rule! We have ants one time Great! And now he's falling asleep. Cue the river of drool. My knee itches. Just one little scratch. Marshall! - You think we should get separate beds? - Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds. Deal! - Don! - Hi. I came to apologize to all of you. I overreacted. Well, we. . Owe you an apology too, Don. We've said some pretty hurtful things. I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth in the first place. No, I acted like a total drama queen. That's not offensive, right? Still not gay. Sorry. The point is you both are clearly very important to Robin So why don't we all have dinner tomorrow night at my place? - Oh, that's great. I must have Robin back. I don't know what it is, but I want Robin back. I know what it is You're like a little kid who throws a toy away And then wants it back the second another kid starts playing with it. Well maybe I wasn't done playing with it. Maybe I just set it down cause I wanted to play with another stuff for a second. Okay. You're ready. Ready for what? To read the letter. Kids The letter was a device I'd invented To remind myself why I'd broken up with somebody. I've been doing it for years. Dear future Ted, Never get back with Karen because she's a pretentious snob. Oh, also she cheated on you. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. See? We're already laughing about it. Dear future Ted, Stay away from Natalie. Or any girl who can pin you to the ground and beat you senseless in front of a cheering crowd. P. S. Please consult a therapist about why that turned you on a little bit. Dear relationship genius Stella left you at the altar, You may never love again. And you'll probably die alone. Huh. It doesn't look so sad written in calligraphy. So when Barney and Robin broke up the previous fall Dating Robin was a huge mistake. Write that down. What? Write yourself a letter. That way, when you miss Robin, And you will, you can remind yourself why you broke up. This ink is cool. Right? Right? You and Robin were a terrible couple. You just didn't work. Sure, you'll always love Robin, But remember other women More importantly remember other boobs, and all that cool stuff you can do with boobs Nozzle, juggle, honka, honka I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. And there's just a bunch of drawings of boobs. I definitely want her back. I don't think human beings were ever meant to sleep in the same bed. Somehow sex and sleep got jumbled together but they're two different things. I know. I mean I love you, but I want this new bed To be a sanctuary for sleep and sleep alone. Me too. And some light snacking but that's it. Hey, you know what we should get? We should get a third bed, just for sex. Oh, yes, a sex bed A dirty, dirty, sex bed. Genius. That way each bed will have a specific purpose. Exactly. We'll have 2 sleep beds, a sex bed, And I'm thinking a bean bag chair just for special birthday stuff. Baby - Can we just revolutionize modern marriage? - Damn straight. hey, Don. I hope you like sushi. How cool is that Don makes do sushi? He learned while on assignment in Japan. Mmm. Ring wormalicious. Barney, be nice. You only want her because you can't have her. It's like if I said "You can sit anywhere in this room except that chair. " - Are you so petty that - My chair! My chair! Oh, spicy tuna with halopania ? My favorite. Mine too. I love spicy food. Probably more than you do. Suck it. Mmm. Super hot. I'm not feeling good. Hey, Lily. You won't believe it. It's the craziest thing. Don has twin beds too, Oh my God! We just got twin beds. Oh, oh. Great. Great. Oh, wait. That "great" didn't sound so great. Well my ex wife and I thought it would be a good idea But we just started to drift apart. Yeah, but I bet you didn't have another bed just for sex. No, but she did, at her personal trainer's house. This chili is like an ice cube in my mouth. I will say this, though I'm gonna get a king size bed if Robin decides to move in. Oh, I'd like that. Hey, hey, hey, Tokyo Don You ever Do this back in Japan? - Wasabi! - Barney, don't! - Oh, my God, Barney! - Aaah! - Awesome! - Give him some milk. But thanks for the reminder, Robin. Oh, you're sweet Well, I hope you're happy. Hey, I stand by what I did. It was bold and romantic. You soiled yourself from both ends of your body. Oh, come on. You have done tons of stupid stuff to impress Robin. Yeah, I did, but I don't anymore, cause I'm over her. You want her back just as much as I do, you just won't let yourself go there. That is ridiculous and I'll tell you why. For my biographer? Just, just focus on the letter, okay? Dear Ted, Robin is the perfect girl for you but she doesn't want to be in a serious relationship. You need someone who wants to settle down. So until Robin is ready for that next step, she's not your girl. Still, I'll always remember stealing her the blue French horn, our first kiss, the look in her eye when she told me she loved me. Dammit. Now I want her back. So that night your uncle Barney and I sat down to have a calm, rational discussion about who deserved Robin more. I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in her arms. She I want to have sex with her at least one more time. And she is not mine either. She's - Don's. We gotta get rid of that guy. Oh my God, Ted, this is how it starts. This is how it starts. I'm scared, Teddy, I'm scared, Teddy. Okay. Oh, baby Baby That's Don. That's not us. Our new sleeping arrangement is only gonna bring us closer together. Now get out of my bed. I don't wanna do that. But you're a million degrees. Honestly, I'm surprised your hourly pee breaks aren't just steam. Well, you're no picnic in bed either. Oh, except for the food and the ants. But Well, I still want to be next to you. Why? So you can kick me and slap me all night? I swear to God, the second you fall asleep is like you grow extra limbs. It's like spooning with a Hindu Didi Ganesh. Wanna push them together? - We're still talking about the beds? - Nope. I'll take her name. Wait. How about this? How about this? We share her. I'll take her until she's forty and then you can have her after that. Who are we kidding, who are we kidding? She's with Don now, We just have to accept that - and move on. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to the bath I'm gonna go to the bathroom. And then I'll skip out Hello? Hey, Robin, it's Barndoor. Guess what. I'm open. Hey, Barndoor. Hang on. I'm getting another call. Teddy bear. Need a little honey? - No. Ted, hang on. Hey, Barney, II'm gonna have to call you back. Ted's on the other line and I I think he's in trouble. Ted's calling you? Oh, he's in trouble alright. Ted, what's up? You've pretty hair. That's what's up. And down your back. Well, we almost let that get out of control. Agreed. I'm gonna get out of here before we do something we regret. Robin! Robin, I love you! - You son of a bitch. I brought you the blue French horn, Robin! Ted is just holding it for me. Sorry, buddy, I was there. Oh God, guysWhat are you doing? Robin, I want you back! Hey, guys, why won't you come upstairs? Oh, hey! Alright! Don Let's settle this! - You, me and Ted. Look, guys, Robin and I have to do our show, so why don't you have a sit on the couch Watch some television and we'll talk about this when we get back, okay? Oh, you gave up easy. game, set Match! Winner wins a chicken dinner Where's Where's this TV you've been bragging about? It's right here. Well, you got to go. What? Oh, I'm sorry. That was a blast. And you're great. I have to be up early, so You're just kicking me out? You knew what this was. Lily, Lily, wait. Don't forget your sweatshirt. Nice try. So do you guys remember anything from last night? Yeah Boy, was Ted drunk. Embarrassing! I'm really sorry. We both are. We were drunk and stupid, but We're gonna do anything we can to make sure that Don feels a part of the group. Don's not gonna be a part of the group. And neither am I. At least for a while. Guys, this thing with Don is real. And I wanna see where it goes. And I'll never be able to do that if I keep hanging our with my ex-boyfriends all the time. It just won't work. I'm moving in with Don. So, what's going on with Robin? You were right. She was just mad. It's been four days and she hasn't said another word about moving out But listen We can never pull crap like that ever again. Agreed. In fact I even wrote myself another letter. Dear future Barney, You think you want Robin back again but you really don't. Let her go. Sincerely, past Barney. P. S. That top part was just for Ted. Did he buy it? good. Now get back together with Robin, but don't mention your plan to Ted cause he'll just screw it up again. And then there's more drawings of boobs. Okay, okay. In my defense, - How great are boobs? - They're pretty great. This is the story of mine. It all started with a visit from my mom and her longtime boyfriend, Clint, who was always saying stuff like "Ted, Your mother is a very Very erotic woman. Please don't. As a painter, slash, songwriter, slash, volunteer fear-fighter, I find her incredibly sexual. But you have your own sexual memories with your mom, don't you? Please don't. Exiting her womb, receiving her milk. You get me? Good. I cannot believe I am with that man. Mom, mom, it's ok. You don't have to settle. There are plenty of guys who He is so cool! And he picked me! Well, I'm, uh I'm glad you're both so happy. Well, good, because we do have an announcement Son. Yes, my mom was lapping me. Getting married for a second time before I was even married once. I was so happy for them. So freaking happy. Still, weddings can be magical. For all I knew, I'd end up sharing a dance with my future wife there. And if you don't boil those jam jars, it's just a welcome mat for bacteria. That wasn't her. Oh, congratulations! Oh! We are so happy for you. I feel like I'm 19 again. Oh. It's like the last 35 years of my life never happened. So wonderful to hear, mom. Son, to show that your mom and I will always be there for you, I want you to have this beautiful picture that I painted. Kids, there was no guitar. Excuse me, Ted. BestWedding Ever. Hello, everyone. Mahallow for being here with us. My entire life Well, this life. I've waited for a muse like Virginia. Baby this is your song. Kids, I swear to God, I blacked out for the next 12 minutes. So I have no idea how the song got to this ending. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin just did. They're happy, you know? Not as happy as I am, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin just did. And then, I told you guys what Robin just did, but you were there for that. I gotta tell the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith! Kids, I can't overstate how horrible it is to be the single guy at your own mother's second wedding. So, Ted, when's your wedding? So, Ted, when's your wedding? When's your wedding? When's your wedding? When's your wedding? Robin cried at Clint's song. Oh, I told you already. Ted's hot sister, Heather! I have to leave. Wait, Ted. What about your toast? Make up some emergency or something. I just I-I can't handle this. Ted, Ted, where are you going? It's your mother's wedding! Uncle Larry, my hand to God. Niagra Falls. She's pouring. And my friends didn't see me for the next 72 hours. Seriously, is Ted okay? I mean, I know it was a rough weekend, but - this radio silence is weird. His mom's called, like, five times asking where he disappeared to. Sorry, Robin. They're all out of pretzels. And I know how emotional you get. Shh. Shh. Let it go. Let it go. Okay! Shh. Okay, I I cried at Clint's song. She cried at Clint's song. I am on top of the world. Come on. We're going for a ride! Hey, buddy, do you want to, maybe, let somebody who isn't having some sort of manic episode drive for a while? Yeah, and where the hell are we going? First, let me tell you what happened the night of the wedding. Watching my mom get married, I realized how far behind I was in my own life. I just had to get out of there. So I went back to my hotel room and got onto this Web site I sometimes visit when I can't sleep Oh! Oh! Oh-oh! Ted, come on. Oh, God. T. M. I. We do not want to know what you and the Internet do when you're lonely. I didn't I That's not the part of the night I was talking about. I went to my favorite real estate auction site Come on, we've all got one scrolled through a few properties and Guys I just bought my dream house. What do you mean you bought this house? I mean, I made a bid online. I won the auction the next day and I got approval. I just finalized the paperwork. And was the Blair Witch easy to deal with, Or did she haggle over the closing costs? Don't even joke about that, man. So, I'm thinking this room will be the study. You know, a place just for Dad. I mean, the kids are welcome in here if they're reading a book, but no toys. It's not a question of withholding love. It's a question of drawing boundaries. Whoa. Ted, this is insane. This is going to take years and a small fortune to make livable. I'm an architect. I'll find a way. And if I start right now, it'll be done by the time the ol' wifey and I are ready to move in. Is she in the room with us right now, Ted? Okay, okay, I know I haven't found Mrs. Mosby yet, but I will, knock on wood. Careful, buddy. Ted, you can't just skip ahead to where you think your life should be. Doesn't work that way. Yeah, I gotta agree. This may be the stupidest thing you've ever done. Stupidest thing any of us has ever done. Okay, all right. Alright? We've all done some stupid things in our lives. For example, I remember a time when I dropped some bottle rockets in the toilet, and I tried to dry them off in the microwave. God, you must have been drunk off your ass. No, too stupid to be an adult. He was obviously a kid when it happened. "Drunk or Kid. " Which one was I? Lock in your guesses. Drunk. Drunk. Kid. Kid. Drumroll, please. I was Drunk! You know, I'm glad Robin got it right. Cause she's very sensitive and fragile. I'm referencing the time she cried at Clint's song. And even though I'm whispering, I actually hope she hears me. Are you crying? I know it's stupid, but Everyone!  They're just happy, you know? Not as happy as I am. I will give you $500 if this just happened to you instead of me. Thank you, Robin. You just saved me unspeakable public humiliation and shame. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin just did. Wait, you guys are Hi, I'm here for the inspection. Oh, great! I was worried you weren't coming. I was actually here a few minutes ago, but I guess the doorbell doesn't work. Hmm. Oh, hey! Doorbell does not work. Wait, wait. You're just getting this place inspected now? Well, yeah. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Okay! All right! All right, let's all remember that we've all done some stupid things in our lives, okay? For example, I once tried to ride my bike down an extension ladder from the roof of a two-story house. The only looming question is Was I drunk or a kid? Drunk! Kid! Kid! Drunk! Drumroll, please. I was Marshall's dead! Marshall's dead! - A kid. under a week. Hey, let's check out the porch, huh? Come on. I'm going to put a grill out here. Every Sunday, right here, it's going to be a total sausage fest. Hmm Sausage party? Burgers, we'll do burgers. Ted, stop it. You can't keep this house. It's a huge mistake. Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, okay? Wife, house, kids. As it turns out, the Universe it's being kind of a  about the whole wife and kids part. So, what's the one thing I can control? The house. I bought it. Now, me driving my brother's car the wrong way down I-94, that was a huge mistake. Drunk! Kid! Kid! Kid! I was A kid. Yes! Wow, Barney. Did you cry on that guy or something? Yeah. You got leaky pipes. the pond in your basement is drowning some of the larger, slower rats. The rest of them, well they're headed this way. See, you should have waited to find out the problems with this house. You can always find problems with any decision, but you can't let that stop you. Freshman year, Marshall knew right away he wanted to spend his life with you. What if someone had been there to second-guess that decision? Bye. I know we've only been on two dates, but dammit, Lily Aldrin, I'm gonna marry you. Not so fast. We got some structural issues here. These hips are not Eriksen baby-compliant. And this thing right here does not have a proper filter. That's a maintenance issue that's never going to go away. And I know you think that you like this Gothic exterior now But deep down, didn't you always picture yourself in something Spanish? I'd recommend you look into the rental option. But Marshall took that leap of faith, and it's the best thing that ever happened to you both. It was Robin! "What?!" Yes, it was Robin who cried at Clint's song! But she saidI know what she said. But here's what she didn't want you to know. Listen, Barney, I can't stand all these jokes about me crying. If I pretend to reveal that you were the one who cried, will you go along with it? Sure. I made a mistake letting you go, didn't I? Your penis is enormous. Dammit. All right, good news. Now, I could keep looking and see what else I can find besides the black mold, the damaged retaining wall, the frayed electrical wires, the lead paint, the water damage, the fire damage, the sun damage, the broken furnace, the rotted floorboards Oh, look at that. No termites. The cracked chimney, the bats, the rats, the spiders, the raccoons, the hobo, the detached gutter, the outdated fuse box and the paint job in the kitchen, which is fine, but the trim really clashes with the countertops. Or I could just recommend that you do not buy this godforsaken Guantanamo Bay of a house, and suggest that we all get our asses out of here before a medium-sized wind blows the whole sumbitch down. What if I already bought the sum'bitch? I- I will check out the upstairs. Did he say he found a hobo? Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house for what I know it can be. I see a swing on that tree outside. I- I see a wreath on the front door at Christmas. I see a grill out on that patio where I'll be barbecuing every weekend. I see a life that I know I can have here. I see a lawsuit. Found termites. Hey, well, the good news is the inspector killed some roaches on impact. Oh, hold on. Giant pole in second floor. Just wanted to make sure the report is thorough. You were right. This was a huge mistake. It's just Everyone's moving on but me. You guys got a place years ago; Robin's getting serious with Don. BarneyMaybe that's a new tie? Thank you. Geez. Now my mom is remarried. I I'm exactly where I was five years ago. I'm sick of it. I'm I'm ready for the life that fits into this house. It's all right, buddy. Sometimes people make the wrong decisions in life. Like your mother. What do you mean? Ted, as you know, I've always been very, very fond of your mother. Please don't. In fact, Virginia and I shared a special moment back in Before Clint. What the hell are you talking about? I wanted to be your dad! - What does that even mean? - Don't you talk back to me, young man. That's why I cried at Clint's song. Because that bastard took her away from me. And now, all I'm left with is the memory of dropping her off at the airport. And that's how you got the brooch? Unbelievable. You SoHere we are. Here we are. We made good time Not a lot of traffic Oh, I love this song. Do you? Hmm. I can Listen Ted's mom. I should reallyI sh  Your penis is enormous. Again?! Always one too far! Okay, all right. Fine, that last part I made up, but the rest of it, I swear it was true. Come on, dude. Your mom is a cougar. Wait, I thought you said a cougar can't be over 50. Okay, she's a Mellencamp. Guys, I am screwed. I mean, the best I can do is level this place and sell the property for a huge loss. Look, Ted Usually in life when you make a stupid decision you just have to live with it. But how often do you get the chance to pick up a sledgehammer and bash the living hell out of it? - This is stupid. Thanks, Lily. That felt fantastic. To Ted Mosby- homeowner, friend, and if he can rent it out, slumlord. There's, uh There's one last thing I gotta do. And my friends didn't see me for the next 72 hours. He was our ride. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so Here it is "How bout a hand for the deejay? Gesture to dee" I'll skip down. "Mom, I love you, "and I've never seen you as happy as you are with Clint. "And, Clint, welcome to the family "What you two have is what I one day hope to find. " But until then, cheers to you both. I love you, guys. Ted I am so baked right now. I'm only 60% sure you're actually standing in front of me. But if you are, I love you. And you are the best son a mother could ever have. There was no logical reason why my mother should be with a guy like that. And yet, as you kids know, being with your Grandpa Clint was the best decision your grandma ever made. Sometimes our best decisions are the ones that don't make any sense at all. How did you know I was gonna be up here today? Robin told me. Happy housewarming. But I-I, I told you the last time I saw you I'm selling the place. I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Look Of all the times over the years when I've said to you "Slow down! Don't rush into things with this girl. " you haven't listened to me a single damn time. Your heart is both drunk and a kid. Can I Can I tell you some of the ideas I have? Yeah. And, kids, Marshall was right. We all make them. But time is funny. And sometimes a little magic It can take a stupid decision and turn it into something else entirely. Because, kids, as you know, That house. is this house. Wait, wait, wait, I got this one. Left. Wrong game. But correct. Five front-row tickets to Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs. Wrestlers? That is awesome! You've heard of Robots vs. Wrestlers? Never. But we assume it's some sort of sporting event That pits robots against wrestlers! That's exactly what it is, According to the Web site!  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who's the fifth ticket for? Uh Robin. I know-- She moved in with her boyfriend And said she doesn't want to hang out with us anymore, But this is Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots Vs. Wrestlers! Barney is right. It's impossible to say no to that. No to that. I wish I could, but I Have plans with don on Saturday. He's making me Chinese. I'll assume you're talking about food, Otherwise, I have some follow-up questions. Oh, I'm sorry, Lily, But I got to give this thing with don a chance. And I can't do that if I'm out drinking with you guys Every single night-- especially when "you guys" Includes two of my ex-boyfriends. I understand. You're right. It's just we all really miss you. Aw, I miss you, too. Oh, listen, I got to go. Talk soon? Okay, bye. Sorry, New York, I had to take that. Now, where were we? Yeah. Yes. Bus crash. She said no? How could she say no? Robots vs. Wrestlers is our most important tradition As a group. Tradition? We've never done this before? It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. Well This is how it starts. First Robin moves in with don, Then Marshall and Lily have a baby, Then Ted Gets married? I was gonna say, "is found alone In his apartment devoured by his cats," But either way, not pretty. Everyone's Leaving me, and I don't like it! Oh, Barney, you don't have to worry About Marshall and me having kids. That's a long way down the road. Exactly-- it's, uh, down the road, A medium way. A medium-long way. I mean, you can see it ahead. In the vast, vast distance. But you're already seeing exit signs for it. Really? I didn't see any. You might want to get in the right lane. I understand how you feel, Barney. Friendships are important. In fact, Emerson wrote A great poem entitled "friendship. " You guys are gonna love this.

And just like that, A picture began to take shape A picture of Marissa Heller, the golfer Marissa Heller, the wicker catalog shopper Marissa Heller, the bird owner. And since then, with each piece of mail we've gotten, The picture's become a little clearer. The only thing We don't know is what she looks like.

They don't make fart noises every time I open my mouth. Now, look, I'm going to stay. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just one night. It doesn't mean anything. Oh, it means everything. Ted, if you don't come to Robots vs. Wrestlers, It's the end of our friendship. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Fine. Then you are out of our gang forever. You can reapply in two years. Marshall, Lily, Let's go watch Wrestlers fight robots. So embarrassing. I forgot something. So Ted, where did those chums of yours scoot off to? Oh, you know. Poetry reading. Best tradition ever! Don't humor me, Marshall. Let's face it. The gang is over. Ted's gone. Robin's gone. We might as well just go our separate ways. God, Barney, enough with t a abandonment issues. Ted's allowed to have a life outside of the group. We all are. Wait a minute. Why are you saying that all of a sudden? Oh, God, you're pregnant! No. Oh, God, you already had the baby! It's right behind me, isn't it? No, you idiot. It's just, eventually, we're all gonna move on. It's called growing up. Is that all you got, bitch? But can you at least promise me That you won't get pregnant for another year? I can't make that promise. You can't?! You can't?!  Hmm? Citrus and honeycomb flavors with crisp acidity. It's a sauv blanc, Loire valley. Town of Sancerre. Ah. Correct again! Bravo, boy!  No! You can't have kids! You don't want to bring a child Into this crazy, messed-up world. I don't know. The world seems pretty awesome right now, Barney. Okay, Lily, you leave me no choice. If you have a daughter, the day, Nay, the minute she turns 18 Gong! Oh, my God! Hey, but Lily. Lily Babies. Oh! I hope Ted is miserable right now. or fall. ♪  Ted, your lyric baritone is outstanding. Thank you, Will Shortz. love me more than the baby; the baby to pick up chicks; the baby falling From a two-story window and me heroically catching it; in front of me; You can whip them out whenever you want. And then, something amazing happened. Holy crap! I don't believe it. Well, of course, hell is an interesting concept, isn't it? I've always loved to imagine it As Dante did in the divine comedy. If you'll allow me. In the original Italian. I cannot believe this. I'm reciting the divine comedy In its original Italian, And nobody's making fart noises!  Wow, this is weird. Never gotten this far. You know, I actually sound kind of douchey. My God, I'm out of control! Listen to me. I'm completely unleashed. I'm the biggest douche on the planet. Ugh! I wish somebody would stop me. And then, somebody did. Kids, I think I told you how earlier that year, We had seen some doppelgangers of ourselves around town. There was lesbian Robin. There was moustache Marshall. And, of course, stripper Lily. Well, that night, One more doppelganger surfaced-- Mexican wrestler Ted. Oh! Oh!  I got to go. Rule number 83. If anything that comes out of that baby Gets on one of my suits, I get to touch Lily's boobs. Dude, what is it with you and my wife's boobs tonight? Hey, hey, I don't make the rules. Baby, are you really starting to think about this? I don't know. Maybe a little. Okay. Well, for whatever it's worth, I think that we're ready. I mean, look, We love each other, We're financially stable, and honestly, I don't think It would change our lifestyle all that much. Aunt Lily still likes To remind Uncle Marshall he once said this. Marshall, if we were at home with a baby tonight, We never would have seen Ted's doppelganger. Imagine missing that. How would that feel? I would blame that child for the rest of his life. Exactly. For the rest of her life. Okay, you're right. There's, there's no hurry. Okay, how about this? We agree there's no sense in having a baby Until we've seen all five doppelgangers, right? Of course. Stands to reason. Okay, so when we finally see Barney's doppelganger, That's the universe telling us it's go time. And that's when we'll start trying. Deal? Deal. Hey, guys. Hey. Well, well, look who thinks He can just waltz in here And be part of the gang again. Well, you can forget it. Listen, Barney, I Please be part of the gang again! I don't want to lose anyone else! We're all really sorry. We'll even let you recite all the douchey poems you want, And we'll never, never say a bad thing about it, I promise. Really? Because There actually is a poem I'd like to recite-- "friendship" by Ralph Waldo Emerson. "a ruddy drop of manly blood, the surging sea outweighs. The world uncertain comes and goes. . ""  I'm sorry. Someone had to do that. Who wants another drink? I'm buying. Kids, I'd love to tell you that over e e years, We didn't all drift apart a little At one time or another. You don't mean for it to happen, but it does. But no matter what, to this day, Come hell or high water, We still all get together every year For Robots vs. Wrestlers. Good night! Thanks a lot. I had a great time. Willem. Willem. Willem. Dafoe! It's a fair question. After all, there's a fine line Between a good story and a bald-faced lie. I've never met anyone Who could work that line better than your Uncle Barney. Heck, he could jump rope with it. I love to travel myself. Really? Where's the best place you've visited? Hawaii's nice. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. That's a good spot. But the best place? I'd have to say the moon. Hi. Neil Armstrong. No! You did not convince a girl that you were The first man to walk on the moon! That happened seven years before you were born! Ted, baby doll, minor hurdle. Oh, yeah, well, our spaceship passed through a wormhole Or some gamma Rays or something. I started aging backwards, blah, blah, blah. So, you work in a yogurt shop. That must be wild. Although, I did actually work In a yogurt store in High School. And it was indeed Wild. Anyhoo, 20 minutes later, the eagle landed. We knocked Space boots. Houston, we have a moaner. Other Space-related double entendres. Why do you feel the need to lie all the time? I'm not lying! Guys, we made sweet love. I got pictures. I hate my job. What are you talking about? I thought you just interviewed the mayor. Mayor mcwoof. He wears a dog costume and teaches kids not to litter. At least He's supposed to. Oh, I don't want to talk about mayor mcwoof. I want to talk about these amazing insoles From bon appe-feet! Just look how shock-absorbent they are! Prop table! Table's a prop! We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Oh. Sorry, Robin. Got bored. Yeah, I don't blame you. Man, just one decent interview Would be so nice for a change. Fine. I'll look at my schedule, see when I'm available. But I want a list of questions ahead of time, And my personal life is off limits. Ted, you caught seven peanuts in a row. It's impressive, but it's not newsworthy. But that's not what I'm talking about that. No. I'm talking about how I was selected to build A scale model of the empire state building For the largest recreation Of the New York skyline in the world. Is that the thing you were playing with the other night? I wasn't playing. I was working. "it's you. " "it's me. " "I saw you in the street. Are you Annie?" "yes. " Ted, are you acting out the last scene Of sleepless in Seattle with little dolls? How long have you been out here? Ten seconds. Yeah. Just the last scene. Oh, Ted. Again? Ooh. That's the pizza. Baby, do you have any cash? Oh. You know, uh, I don't I actually I don't think that I should Have to pay. 'cause I'm not a fan of pizza. What?! Marshall, we've driven halfway across the country For a piece of pizza literally hundreds of times. I once caught you eating pizza in the shower. Marshall, there's a cartoon of you on our coupons. I'm not saying Marshall's a guy who likes pizza, But last time he went in for a physical, Doctor says, "marshall, you got to stop eating pizza. " Marshall says, "why?" doc says, "so I can examine you. " But seriously, we kid because we love. All right, look, the reason That I don't have any money on me is because I got mugged. You? What? Can somebody please pay Arthur? All right? I'm starving! How's your dad, by the way? Better. Good. Mm. Mm. Oh, my God, you got mugged?! Who mugged you? Was he wearing a black skull-knit cap And a five o'clock shadow? Did he say, "stick 'em up?" Yes, Barney, because I got mugged in 1947 At the corner of abbott and costello. No. I was cutting through central park on my way home from work Watch it. Don't get any closer. It's cool. It's cool. It was Completely terrifying. It was Completely terrifying. What are you doing? I'm rehearsing. I'm gonna pretend this happened to me later To try and get some sympathy sex. Barney, that won't work. Will it? Big time. I'll allow it. I can't believe Someone pointed a gun at my marshmallow. Now, I'm shaking. I-I don't think I'm going to be able to sleep tonight. Oh! Here, sweetie. I have something that will help you sleep. Just stick this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a freakin' baby. Robin, put that away. It's not going to hurt anyone. The safety's on. Okay, you know what? Let's all just relax. We don't need a gun. I'd just like to forget this ever happened And try to move on with my life. Just like to forget this ever happened And try to move on with my life. This is great stuff. I think I'm gonna add tears, though. Listen, baby, I know that it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine, okay? Can we just put this behind us? Oh, that's gold, but I'm going To switch it to " put me behind you. " Look, baby, you don't have to worry about me. I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I'm a new yorker. I'm not gonna let this change me. I've changed! I'm a gun person now. Clip! Yeah, maybe we should just take A break for a little bit I said, "clip. " You want to get a gun? Not a scary one. Just a cute, little, pink beretta that matches These adorable strappy sandals I just bought. By the way, our new credit card works. You don't need a gun. Every statistic in the world points to the fact that It's safer not to have a gun in the home than to have one, Especially in our home. You know how I'm always accidentally injuring you. Pretty easy, right? Hurry up, baby. The party's about to start. Boo! Oh, my God, Lily! I thought you were going as a sexy cat! I changed my mind. And now you want to bring a gun into that equation? I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I picture that guy pointing a gun at you. And you're my whole world, Marshall. If something ever happened to you, I would just I would just Okay. Okay No, I know. I know. Okay, look, I've got to admit something. That mugging didn't happen exactly the way that I said it did. Aha! So he was wearing a black, skull-knit cap. Told Ja! No, he wasn't wearing A black, skull-knit cap. He wasn't wearing anything. Wait, so Watch it. Don't get any closer. It's It's cool. It's cool. He naked-muggered you? I'm not going to ask where he was keeping the gun. Are we sure it was a gun? Okay, no, guys. I was, I was walking home from work Through central park, And I stopped at the zoo. Watch it. Don't get any closer. Oh, it's cool. It's cool. You're telling us That you got mugged By a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey. You got mugged by a monkey? Yep, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I made up the other story. But the point is, Lily, you don't need a gun. Oh, forget about the gun. We're on this now. Whoa, monkeys are mugging people now? It really is a jungle out there. Oh, my God! That monkey has our address. What if he's in a gang? I hope he doesn't do a swing-by. Why didn't you just ask the zookeeper to get your wallet back? 'cause I saw what the monkey was doing with it, And I didn't really want it after that. Hey, guys. What's up? Oh, some new information has come to light on Marshall's mugging. Oh, really? Did they catch the guy? Well, he's behind bars. Well, where did they find him? Oh, I'm guessing naked in a tree, throwing his own feces. Oh, I've seen that guy. See, that's why I take cabs. You know how they caught him, right? There was a tail on him. There was a tail on him! Okay What is going on? All right, Robin, here's what happened. No-no-no-no! Let me tell it. It's my story. You see, young Marshall Was at the zoo eating a banana No, I wasn't eating a banana! If you're gonna tell it, tell it right. Oh, you're right. The banana was on the ground. There was no There was no banana. Marshall, I apologize truly. Robin, here's what happened. Oh, God. Oh, God, don't shoot. There was no banana! Oh, come on. Barney, I know, Marshall didn't get mugged by a monkey. Marshall? That part he got right. Guys! This is not an uncommon thing, okay? In Thailand, in China, in Costa Rica, People get mugged by monkeys all the time. Monkeys are gatherers. Because of their intersocial dynamics, Having a predisposition towards stealing Gives one a genetic advantage. You were mugged by a monkey! Maybe he was just curious. Were you wearing a yellow hat? Marshall, in all seriousness, this is a great story. I mean, can I interview you about it on my show? What?! He gets to be on your show? What about my model? No one wants to see a guy come on my show and play with dolls. Okay, first of all, that is not what it is. And second of all, You just had a guy on your show playing with dolls. So, your dolls are favored to win At the rhinebeck collector awards next month. Only if they behave themselves. Last year, I found one of them cavorting With a g. I. Joe. It's not funny. What were you thinking? What if you'd gotten pregnant? And you invited him back for a follow-up interview. Only because the FBI asked us To keep him occupied while they search his house. Come on, Marshall. I need the story. It's got everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the empire state building That takes up my entire living room And makes the whole place smell like glue. Come on. Do this for me As a friend? It'd be fun to see you on tv. Yeah. Okay Can you promise to present it in a way That doesn't make a joke out of the fact That I got mugged by a monkey? You got mugged by a monkey. Oh, my God. I just got mugged. What? Is what I was saying to this girl at the bar earlier It was completely terrifying. I just want to forget This ever happened and try to move on with my life. Oh, you poor thing. Neil? Neil. Neil. I I Neil! Lady, my name's not Neil. It's bar Gah-gah! Why are you calling him Neil? Because that's his name. He's Neil Armstrong. The cyclist? I thought You were supposed to be on a shuttle mission? I thought you just got mugged. Okay, I can do this. Uh, uh, you see, I was on my way to the launch pad When I was mugged. And the mugger took my space shuttle keys. Nailed it. Who's up for a three-way? I am. Me, too. And it was the best three-way ever. Strange, 'cause you look Like you just had two vodka tonics thrown in your face. And you have lime in your hair. I do? The story's better with my ending. Just Okay? So, there we are, zero gravity. The three of us wearing nothing but space helmets Marshall! You won't believe it. I pitched the monkey mugger story To my producer and he loves it! Oh Wow. Yeah! Really? Cool. Yeah! I mean, who's ever heard of a guy getting mugged by a monkey? No one except for the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica, and plenty of other countries Where monkey crime is an extremely common nuisance. Well, the best part is, he said that It might get picked up to go national. Guys, this monkey mugger story could make me famous. Me, too. Guys, this is bad. I-I can't, I can't do this. So, it'll be a little embarrassing so what? It's not that. Guys I wasn't mugged by a monkey. So, you weren't mugged by a monkey? No, I wasn't. So what you're saying is The monkey tricked you into giving him your wallet? No, that's not what I'm saying. So you mugged the monkey? Guys, there was no monkey! It was a human being with a gun. Are you sure it wasn't one monkey Standing on another monkey's shoulders, Wearing a men's trench coat? Be about the right height. No! I I just made that story up So that Lily wouldn't get a gun. The truth is that it never happened. I don't buy it. What? You heard me. I think you were mugged by a monkey. You just don't want to go on Robin's show 'cause you're afraid it'll make you Look like a big joke. Well, won't it? The biggest, 'cause it's so funny. Well, it never happened, okay? And I can lie to you guys about it because you're my best friends. I am, but go on. But I can't lie about it on national tv. Ted, you've known him the longest. Is he telling the truth? Ted, don't I can't tell. He smells good. But I just can't tell. Well, I'm still saying it happened. Maybe. But, Marshall, if you didn't get mugged by a monkey, You can't let Robin report it on her show. I mean, this could hurt her credibility. Oh, please! Journalists lie all the time. I'm sorry, but I will believe That Jack Palance is dead when I see the body. Okay, this may come as a shock to you, Barney, But people don't like to be lied to. Wrong! They don't like finding out they've been lied to. "because a lie is just a great story That someone ruined with the truth. " Barney Stinson. Case in point, what that girl Sarah did to me! I think you mean what you did to her. No, I mean what she did to me. The truth is, I'm afraid the three-way story Didn't go exactly the way I said it did. Nailed it. Who's up for a three-way? Lisa, wait. Yes, Neil? Oh, you're Lisa? Sarah, wait. Look. I'm not Neil Armstrong. I'm sorry I lied. Well, I guess I wasn't completely honest with you, either. I mean, I said that I was 28, But the truth is that I'm really 31. And if we're being completely honest, I went to the doctor the other day and found out 31! I was happy, very happy, Thinking that I had nailed a People want the lie. Marshall, they need the lie, which is why, As far as I'm concerned, you were mugged by a monkey. Just as sure as I had that three-way. I am the greatest in the world! Bar Barney! Is that the three-way belt? You know it. Props! Man, I slept so great last night. Can you believe I almost bought a gun? I'm so glad you got mugged by a monkey. Okay You guys got me. I was just nervous. I, I got mugged by a monkey. Yes! I knew it. Wait a minute. Now I'm thinking You really weren't mugged by a monkey. Come on, Ted. Why would he make something like that up? Yeah, come on, Ted. Come here. Okay, seriously, what is that cologne? It's intoxicating. So, late the following night, We all went to the set of Robin's show. Okay, Marshall, now, don't be nervous. What we're going to do is we're going to sit you What the hell is this? I don't know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. Guess if you want to find out, You're going to have to do a story on it. You're going to be covered by a sheet If you don't get your stupid model out of here. Dude, what are you doing? I don't think Marshall's going to lie on tv. And when he backs out, I want to be there For my friend, Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, Because that's how tall a certain iconic New York landmark is. Now, I want to buy a gun. Whoa, the monkey's here. Yeah, surprise. We thought it would help the story To bring him here so you could face your attacker. Yeah. Because of this incident, We will be sending Captain Bobo to a wildlife sanctuary. Oh, I bet he'll like it there. No, ma'am. You see, we'll be splitting him up from his mate, Milly. They've been together for a long time. His mate's name is Milly? And then, the interview began. Marshall, in your own words, Describe what happened. Well, I would, I I would love to tell you what happened, Robin. But I'm just, I'm so curious As to what is going on underneath that sheet. Well, we're not here to talk about that. We're here to talk about your mugging. Right. Well, people get mugged in New York City all the time, Robin, but how often do you get to see Whatever's under that sheet? Mike, can we get a shot of that? We'll be right back. We're clear. What the hell are you doing? Robin, I I wasn't really mugged by a monkey, okay? I just made up that story so that Lily wouldn't buy a gun. So you weren't mugged by a monkey? No, what are you talking about, baby? Of course I was mugged by a monkey. Great, tell it to America. We're back in five. No-no-no, not back in five. I wasn't mugged by a monkey. Okay, that's it. I'm getting a gun. No-no-no! Don't get a gun. I was mugged by a monkey. Well, then Bobo here is going away. Wasn't! I wasn't mugged by a monkey! Ted, do you have any idea if Marshall was mugged by a monkey? None whatsoever. Just tell me, were you or were you not mugged by Captain Bobo? Yeah, baby, just tell us what really happened. Yeah, Marshall, just us tell the truth. And that's when Marshall realized There was only one thing he could say. All right! Here's the truth. I Am going back to bed. And that was it. We never found out what really happened to Uncle Marshall's wallet. But we do know this. Aunt Lily never got a gun, Robin's credibility remained unimpeached, And Bobo and Milly lived out their days together In the Central Park Zoo. Damn it. All right, Ted, mic up. Mic'd up and made up. Red leather, yellow leather. Well, that wasn't very satisfying. When I tell everyone at work this story, I'm saying he was mugged by a monkey. And I'm going to keep the banana on a string thing. That was working. Barney, enough with the lies. You can't just tack on a new ending because you're not satisfied with how a story wraps up. Oh, really? Well, mark my words, Mosby. Someday you'll be telling this story, you'll see it my way. Doubtful. And then, kids, you'll never believe what happened. The monkey got loose! He's got one of my dolls! Bobo, come here, Bobo. Bobo Whow whow whow He's climbing the building! Bobo, come here. I'll get him. Is this really happening? Sure is, Ted. There was Lesbian Robin Mustache Marshall Stripper Lily and Mexican Wrestler Me. Yes, mine was the coolest. Barney's. Turned out, it was more important to some of us than others. We agree there's no sense in having a baby until we've seen all five doppelgangers, right? Yeah, of course. Stands to reason. Okay, so, when we finally see Barney's doppelganger, that's the universe telling us it's go time. And that's when we'll start trying. Deal? Deal. And then one day, a few weeks later Baby, were we serious about the whole Fifth Doppelganger thing? I mean, having a baby is a pretty big thing to leave up to the universe. Yeah, I know it's crazy. It's just so much easier to let the universe decide. Why do you ask? Boom! Universed! Oh, my God! Wait, wait, wait, hold on. That could easily be Barney pulling some scam to meet chicks. I'm one step ahead of you. Go for Barney. Barney, hey. It's Marshall. So you are at work? You're not-- I don't know-- driving a cab, wearing a wig. Yes, I'm at work. That's the sound of my stapler. That's the sound of my three-hole punch. And this is the sound of me filing my corporate guidelines on sexual harassment. What is up?! Got to go, Big Chief. Barney's at work. That-that was The Fifth Doppelganger. Marshall Eriksen put a baby in my belly. I can't wait to tell the gang. This is one of those moments you dream about. "Guys "Lily and I are having unprotected sex. " Ooh, I just got the chills. We're not gonna say anything. What? Why? Marshall, if we tell them, we're basically inviting them into the most private, intimate moment of our lives. You guys banging? Keep going; I'm not even here. huge mistake. Now, show me what you got. How you guys gonna handle the whole Santa thing? I'm thinking, just be honest. Ah, hell. I'll dress up. This just in is what Marshall Eriksen is about to say to his wife as he attempts to impregnate her. 2010. " Okay, fine. I won't tell anybody about the baby thing. Hey, guys. Hey. Guys We saw The Fifth Doppelganger! Whoa! Amazing! That is awesome! Mm-hmm. Ooh, freaky. A brunette Barney. I know. Say what you will about the guy, but Barney seems right as a blond. Well, that's true. Not every dude can pull that off the blond look. I don't know about that. What? Oh, that summer I was lifeguarding at the Chagrin Falls Country Club, I was lathering a little lemon juice into the old mop, playing with some natural highlights. Let's just say there were a few senior citizens who pretended to drown on my watch. And sadly, one who did. Anyway, I'd look good blond. Okay, people, we're in a delicate but very, very promising situation here. If we play the next 30 seconds right, Ted will dye his hair blond. Guys, this is mean. We can't-- uhp, just pictured it. How do we do this? What are we all thinking about? Nachos? Ted Mosby responds to one thing above all else. I don't know, I'm still kind of full from lunch. A bunch of people emphatically telling him not to do something. Follow my lead. Ah, screw it, I could eat. Yes, we'd all like some nachos. I love you, buddy, but there's absolutely no way that you could pull off blond. It-it just wouldn't look right. Yeah, seriously, Ted, don't go blond. I'm going blond! No! No! That is not the outcome we were hoping for! Now, kids, Robin and Don were becoming such a great team, both off and on the air, that local Channel 12 started asking them to guest-host some of their other top-notch programs. So, that's why Monty and I vow never to do drugs. Because drugs are bad. Right, Monty? We, sure, man-made chemical stuff. But things that grow in nature-- they're okay to try, like, once or twice. Not looking for gray areas here, Monty. I don't think it's right to lie to the kids, Moo-Moo. So what are you saying? I've experimented with drugs. highest-rated Monty and Moo-Moo episode ever. Mmm. Hmm, what was that for? Before I met you, I'd given up on everything. Relationships, career, pants. But you made me want to try again. I love you for that. Oh. Huh? Ooh. Oh, I see. Mmm. Hi. Hey, hi. Sorry. Um, you don't know me, but I just wanted to say thank you. You're actually a very important person in my life. Important? More like legendary. Marshall, it's me! Barney! Oddly enough, this would rank as only the second biggest surprise of the day. Wow, this is just very sudden. Sure, I can get you an answer by tomorrow. Okay. Thanks. Ted, something big has just happened, and you're the most sensible person I know. I need to talk to you right now. You know what, it can wait. No, go ahead. I'm listening. Okay, well, the executive producer from WNKW happened to see our show the other morning and loved me. They offered me the lead anchor job, starting next week. Wow, that's great! It is great. But, um, here's the catch. WNKW is in H-Helen, kill the dryer! Is in Chicago. But you were The Fifth Doppelganger. How-how can you be you? I called you, Barney; We had a whole conversation! Ah, yes, I know what happened. See, people at work have this very strange expectation that I, well, work. I know, I know. So to make my colleagues think I'm busting my hump when I'm really out humping busty chicks, I decided to record a special message. What is up?! Got to go, Big Chief. How can it be a recording? You called me Big Chief, my special workplace nickname. Oh, buddy. Hey, hey. Come on, Big Chief. Don't. Just don't. Why does this have to happen now? I mean, just when things are going so great with Don. Career versus romance. "Never-ending battle"? Career has been trouncing romance for years. It's like the Globetrotters versus the Generals. Career's sinking hook shots from half court, Romance is just a bunch of slow white guys who couldn't make it in the Italian league. Ted, I'm lost. What should I do? Okay, you seriously need to talk to Don about this. I'm just too confused to put this on Don. I need to leave him out of it until I figure out what I want. That makes sense. Yeah. And I'm sorry I can't give you better advice on this. The truth is, it's impossible for me to be objective about you moving away. Mm. Did you get a manicure? No, I didn't get a He sure did. Flo! Why are you brunette and driving a cab? Oh, that. You know how it's my dream to have sex with at least one woman from every country on the planet? Sure. Wow. You're doing surprisingly well in the Baltics. Mm-hmm. So, I figure, what's the quickest way to get around the world in 180 lays? Lease a cab and wait outside the U. N. building for hot foreign chicks. It was the perfect plan. There was only one small detail I didn't take into account. Chicks don't want to bang cab drivers. Chicks do not want to bang cab drivers! And I put a lot of work into this one. I can't believe this. Now I got to tell Lily The Fifth Doppelganger is a fake. So? What does she care? Lily decided that once we spotted your doppelganger, we'd start trying to have kids. no kids until you're at least 45! Do you ever read my blog?! It's gotten a lot better. I'm ready to be a dad, you know? But Lily needs some sign from the universe. And now it could be years. I'm sorry, buddy. That'll be $37. 50. So that night, Marshall went home to break the bad news to Lily. The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, let's make a baby. I Okay. Hey. Hey. Hang on, hang on, hang on. I heard you were doing this, so I worked on some stuff. Uh, hey, uh, I'm planning a "White Wedding. " Tell me, Billy Idol, is it a nice day for that? Some other Billy Idol ones. Um, if anyone's looking for the real Slim Shady, he's right here. That one's only okay. Robin, why aren't you getting in on this? Okay, first of all, I'm getting tons of compliments. Second of all, tell him. He's not getting tons of compliments. No, the other thing. Oh. I might move to Chicago next week. Mm, um, hey, baby. Hmm? Not for nothing or nothing, but we'd still be doing this even if we hadn't seen Doppelganger Barney, right? Ooh, but we did see him, which means the universe-- in all its infinite wisdom-- is telling you to stick me and stick me real good. I can't. I can't in good conscience stick you. I know what's bothering you. Really? The cabbages didn't look enough like Barney. Well, that's just not true. No! Time-out! This is a group decision! You can't just move to Chicago unless we all say it's okay. Barney, I think this has to be Robin's Stay out of this, Brigitte Nielsen or Dolph Lundgren from Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily. That cabbie was like a foot shorter than Barney! He was the exact same size! And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, that guy was like a tiny, graying Asian man WI-with a soul patch and a potbelly. Have you completely forgotten what Barney looks like?! You guys banging? Why are you in our bedroom? Why are you in our bedroom? Why is Ellen DeGeneres in our bedroom? Hey, this is working! Wait a minute. Candles Flowers Oh, I guess Marshall "forgot" to tell you. The Fifth Doppelganger was me. What? Wait, and you knew about this? You lied to me? By omission, and it's only because this whole "leave it to the universe" thing of yours is insane, Lily. Baby, you Lily, we need to be in control of our own Guys, guys! We're forgetting what's really important here. Ted's blond. Guys, I am pulling this off. Now, Robin has something important to tell you. He's not pulling it off. No, the other thing. He got a manicure. The other thing. I got a job offer in Chicago. Whoa. That's why we all came down here-- to try and talk Robin out of making a huge Actually, I-I've, I've already made a decision. Guys, I gotta take it. I can't believe we're losing Robin. Guys, this might be the depression talking, but is Ted's hair starting to look kind of good? Thank God, I thought I was the only one! He looks like a freakin' movie star! Oh, and by the way, this was a huge mistake. I'm changing my hair back. Smart. Told ya. Not at all awesome. Hey. Hey. Hey. So, I just got off the phone with Chicago. Yes, I have made a decision. Um I appreciate the offer, but I can't take the job. Thanks. I'm staying. Damn straight! Yay! Robin! Hey, Lily, tell me something. When you saw actual Barney driving that cab, and you thought he was a petite, potbellied Asian man? I know. Weird, right? It's not weird. It means you're not ready. And I'm I'm sorry that I tried to rush things. Our baby can wait for the real Doppelganger Barney. Oh Mm. Mm. Hey, Moo-Moo. Monty made you thin-crust pizza just the way you like it! Hi. Mmm You okay? Robin, you're not gonna believe this. I got offered the lead anchor job at WNKW in Chicago. Oh. Um, what'd you say? I said yes. I've been waiting years for a shot like this. Barney? I am simple street performer from Estonia. Who is this Barney? Oh, he's just this guy we know who has, like, a really lame blog. I hear it's getting better. I mean, wha-what is "blog"? It's just something that was cool, like, eight years ago. Still cool. Still sounds pretty cool, man. What's your name? Kristof. Kristof what? Kristof Doppelganger. Really? Yep. You're gonna go with the last name "Doppelganger"? That's my name, man. Bro Robin, wait. Please try to understand. I gotta get out of here. Wait. Put yourself in my shoes. Can you imagine what it's like to have the phone ring, and it's your dream job on the other end? Yes I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don. Barney, why are you doing this? Wait a minute. Could it, could it be that Barney Stinson actually wants us to have kids? Who is this Barney?! Take American chill pill! Well, let me tell you about him. He talks a big game about how no one should ever have kids before they're at least 45. I would be interested in reading some of these opinions in blog form. But I think I know what happened. Yesterday, Barney thought he had to say good-bye to someone he truly loves. And it got him thinking Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing if a baby joined our little group. Babies can be cute. Mm. And someday, he's gonna make the best uncle in the world. Because this Barney He's family to us. Excuse me. I heard you're from Estonia. So am I. Excuse me one moment. Estonia would close out the Baltics! And I am street performer like you. Ay-yi-yi-yi! Hey. Say yes to this. Okay. Can I move back in? Yes. But, Ted, am I just the biggest idiot in the world? Look, think about all of us five years ago when we first met you. Marshall and Lily were just boyfriend and girlfriend. Now they're married and thinking about kids. And Barney? Barney was never gonna commit to anyone ever. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing some girl I was convinced was "The One. " Now she's one of my closest friends. And you? Five years ago, you never would have chosen love over your career, but today you did. Looks like I'm getting dumber. No, just more courageous. Look, we've all been searching for The Five Doppelgangers, right? Mm. But eventually, over time, we all become our own doppelgangers. You know, these these completely different people who just happen to look like us. "Five Years Ago Robin"? That girl, she was pretty great. But Doppelganger Robin? She's amazing. We've, um, we've had a lot to drink I don't care. What? Oh. Oh, yeah. I forgot I'm blond. I have blond hair. And that's the story of how dying my hair blond kept us from doing something we both would have regretted that night. Kids, the universe is funny. Oh, my God! Yes! You're here! This is fantastic! Baby, simmer. Your husband's right there. At least attempt to hide it. Guys, follow me! Guys, look! The Fifth Doppelganger! Uh, Lily? That dude looks noth Guys Go with it. Kids, you can ask the universe for signs all you want It's uncanny. Right? Just like Barney. Amazing. It's like looking in the mirror. But ultimately, we only see what we want to see when we're ready to see it. So, um, does this mean? Marshall Eriksen put a baby in my belly. Mm Sure, you can stick to the small talk and pretend it's not there, but sooner or later It's my ex. Sorry. We're trying to remain friends. Hi, pumpkin! Did you get our tickets to Maui? Yeah, it's there. That spring I just started dating a girl named Royce. She was smart, beautiful Blah-blah-blah, we're very happy together. But Exactly. That's the problem. Her butt? What is it, too much? Too little? Or is it an issue of access? No, the "but" is, there's always gonna be a "but. " No matter how great things are going, sooner or later, it's gonna get ruined. When she turns 30. When I find out what her baggage is. It's there. I don't know what it is, but when I do, party's over. Whoa. Ted, please tell me you are not impugning emotional baggage. Baggage is a good thing? Emotional baggage is the bedrock of America's most important cultural export. Porn. Actually, it's porn. Only women with major baggage go into porn. Major Baggage. Ted, everyone has baggage. You just got to look past it. Really? 'Cause the last time I looked past a girl's baggage, that baggage belonged to a girl named Stella, and, oh, I'm drawing a blank here. How did that work out again? Here's how it worked out. Marry me. I asked her to marry me. She said yes. We were happy. But then the day of the wedding, her karate instructor ex-boyfriend Tony Grafanello showed up, declared his love for her, and Stella ran off with him to California, leaving me utterly and completely heartbroken. Ted, look, what happened with Stella was awful, but that doesn't mean anyone with baggage is undateable. Well, I'm just glad that we met young enough that I don't have any baggage. Mother issues. I do not. Grandmother issues. Definitely do not. Great-grandmother issues. I just don't like it when she picks me up. And you know what your biggest baggage is? You're too nice. How is being nice baggage? Have you ever seen you walk down the street? I don't even know how to answer hat. Well, let me help you out. Michael! Javier, Marcello! Susanne. Hey, Deng, let me help you with that. That ought to do it. Oh, guys, no. I could not today. It would just be That's normal. There is only one street where that is normal. A giant yellow bird lives on it. Well, I'll be pretty happy if Royce's only baggage is that she's too nice. Too nice? That is the worst kind of baggage. Hates her dad and thinks she's fat, but isn't. Angry sex on the first date, and then as soon as you mention breakfast, she's gone. Why do guys hang out with me? That night on my date with Royce, I kept waiting to see what her baggage would be. So, is spaghetti your specialty? Uh, no. The main event is my pancakes. I'll make 'em for you sometime. They are insane. My dad used to make multigrain pancakes. He's the one who got me working in porn. You know PORN? "Parents Offering Recognition and Nutrition"? It's a charity for inner-city teens who don't have access to sports or healthy food. That reminds me I killed my brother With this joke I told him last night. A barber, a stripper and a Jew lliard-trained violinist walk into a bar. I looked and looked and looked, but it really appeared as though there was no baggage to worry about until we went to go see a movie. ♪ Oh, no. Hey, what took you guys so long? Nothing. Forget about it. We were on our way here, and Marshall wanted to stop and help some guys load their moving van. To be nice. It didn't cost nothing. D when the moving van drove away, who should show up but the owner of the apartment we had just helped some guys rob. And that one was hard to explain to the police. See, Marshall? This is what I mean. You can't treat New York City like it's the small, friendly, crime-free, inbred, backwoods, Podunk, cow-tipping, Minnesota Hickville where you grew up. Crime-free? Yeah. Crime-free? In 1994, the cashier from the feed store was held up at hoepoint. And besides, I like being friendly, okay? I'm not gonna change that about myself. No, don't change, baby. I think it's sweet. Sweet, sweet. Sweet mother of God, he's an idiot sometimes. He actually lent the burglars gas money. He gave them money? Not gave, lent. They said that they would send us a check, so Marshall gave them our address. What's to stop them from coming to our apartment one night and maybe tying me up? I mean, sure, Marshall and I like to pretend, but the reality is scary. Why don't you say something to him? What's the point? He's from Minnesota. His high school mascot was a hug. Hey, guys. Hey! How'd the date with Royce go? It was interesting. We went to see that new movie The Wedding Bride. Oh, how was it?! Not that I care. I mean, that's a chick flick. 40 because I have that meeting. 10. What's that movie about, anyway? That's the interesting part. Hey, bonehead, I'm Jed Mosely! I'm the most powerful and corrupt architect in New York. I want It's about me. The Wedding Bride is about you? Yeah. Okay, are you sure it's about you? Because when I saw Spaceballs for the first time, I could have sworn This movie is about me, Marshall. It was written by Tony Grafanello. Tony Grafanello? That's the Yeah, the guy that Stella left me for. This movie is the whole story of our breakup. Why would he write a movie about that? Isn't he the bad guy in that story? Yeah, and the good guy is a guy named Ted Mosby. Funny, that was my memory of it, too. But according to the movie Mr. Mosley, your fiancé is here. Great, the old ball and chain. I can't wait to make her move out of her beautiful house in New Jersey and come live with me in an apartment above a bar. Send her in! Ah! Stella, to what do I owe the pleasure? We're supposed to taste wedding cakes this afternoon, remember? Ouch! No-can-do's-ville, baby doll. Whoa! Aw Well, I am stunned. Right? That's what passes for comedy these days? "Whoa, I'm falling back in my chair! Whoa!" Whoa. I'm really falling back in my chair. Oh, baby! Okay, that was pretty funny. What a jerk. Did he at least get someone hot to play me? You're not in it. What a jerk! No. No, no, no, Tony's not a jerk. Not according to the movie, anyway. I'm going through with this wedding. I'm sorry, Tony. Stella, your happiness is the only thing I care about, except for these underprivileged children that I work with for free. Aw! I love him. It's not that easy, Tony. Jed Mosely may not be as handsome as you are, as Tall as you are I'm taller than that guy. and our sex life is terrible. Once, he even fell asleep while we were doing it. I mean It was one time. I was on cold medicine! What? Nothing. This is a terrible movie! And it got everything wrong! Re-Remember how I proposed to Stella? That spontaneous moment in the arcade; I didn't have a ring, so I gave her a toy I won from a crane machine? Oh, that was so sweet. So romantic. A little cheesy. Well, here's how it went Look, if it'll shut you up, I guess we can get married. Aren't you gonna give me a ring? No-can-do's-ville, baby doll. Here, put is on your finger. Hey! And remember the two-minute date? When I squeezed an entire romantic evening into just two minutes to accommodate Stella's busy schedule? Oh, Ted, you're such a good guy. That was really nice. Also a little cheesy. Well, according to the movie What about our big romantic weekend? No-can-do's-ville, baby doll. Alls I got time for is a two-minute date, if you know what I mean. Sex! Whoa! Aw! Hey, if you know what you're doing, two minutes is all you need. Run tell DAT. But the worst, the worst was the ending. So they're at the wedding Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely to be your lawfully wedded husband? I Whoa-oh! Spoilers! Is what, is what I would say if ever plan on seeing such an awful film! Continue. So they're at the wedding I Stella! Tony! Tony?! Something I need to say. A long time ago, I let this beautiful girl named Stella get away. And now she's with some jerk who doesn't appreciate what he has in this beautiful wedding bride. Aw! What is wrong with you people?! You can't talk to me like that! I'm Ted Mosely! Did he say "Ted" that time? Shh! Stella, I promised to make you my wife. And I'd like to live up to that promise. Oh, Tony, all I've wanted all my life was your love. Oh, go on, honey, kiss him. Kiss him! Kiss him! Stella, if you still truly love me Kiss him! Kiss him! Will you let me make you my wedding bride? Kiss him! Kiss him! Kiss him! Can-do's-ville, baby doll. No, no, no! Stop doing that! Daddy! Take that, Ted Mosby! Okay, he definitely said it that time. Oh, my God! That was so good! I'm laughing, I'm crying. I I know it's all fake, but didn't those seem like real characters? It was just so real! Hey, how come you said, "Oh, no" when the movie started? That's when I realized everyone has baggage including me. Oh, uh, no reason. Ted, I think you need to tell Royce the story of what happened with you and Stella. It-it's gonna come out eventually. Why? Why does it even have to? Well, for starters, it's now the fifth highest grossing movie of all time. I don't care. I don't care. I'm taking this to the grave. It's a stupid movie anyway! Sounds terrible. I would never go see that film because I support you and I love you. Kids, you know where this is going. Well, she's made her choice. Don't worry. I won't go to the wedding. Oh, you'll go all right! I'm gonna drive you there myself and make you watch! Billy, no! The code. This is exactly how it happened. He got every part right. Even the thing with the nunchucks. So I was resolved to put The Wedding Bride as far behind me as possible. Unfortunately Oh, how great was The Wedding Bride? Oh! Loved it! Loved it, loved it, loved it! We're going to see it again tomorrow. Oh, can we come? Ted, you want to see it again, right? Yeah, it was good. "Good"? Try instant classic! The only thing wrong with it-- and I mean, it's such a minor flaw in an otherwise flawless film-- is, I just didn't get why Stella would even want to marry a guy like Jed Mosely in the first place. Jed Mosely. Come on, Royce. You've dated a few Jed Moselys in your day. Well, okay, but who hasn't? He's such a type; The butterfly tattoo, the way he pronounces encyclopedia. Ugh! Encyclo-pay-dia. Totally, totally. Well, technically, that is the correct pronunciation. I was so, so happy when that loser got left at the altar. And you know why? Because he had it coming. Mm-hmm. And the great part is, he is gonna live a long, sad life, knowing that he lost his only chance at happiness. Oh, and what about when he got beat up by the goat?! So funny! What a loser! Totally. Totally! I mean, the guy's life was shattered in a very public humiliation. What a hoot! It may be years before he can look certain family members in the eye again. He may be so emotionally traumatized, he never fully loves or trusts anyone ever again. It was hysterical! Move over, Adolf Hitler, there's a new king of comedy, right? Ted, are you okay? No, I just think you all might be interested to learn something about that movie you all love so much. It sucks And you're all stupid for liking it. Wow. That was really mean and I think you owe us an apology. No-can-do's-ville, baby doll No-can-do's-ville You said, "No-can-do's- ville, baby doll"? You actually used Jed Mosely's catchphrase? I know! I was just so upset that they How do you know that's his catchphrase? You dragged me into it. I didn't wanna go. I wanted to see Avatar. That's it. I'm just gonna move to some country where no one's seen The Wedding Bride. Good luck, Ted. That movie is worldwide. It's huge. Maybe North Korea? Nope. I read that Kim Jong IL said it's his second favorite movie of all time. Right behind a movie of him riding a horse in slow motion Sorry, Ted. You're screwed. No, Ted, you know what, no, Ted is not screwed. Do you guys want to know why I'm nice to everyone? It's because I don't care bout baggage. I mean, most people, they see another person walking down the street with that big heavy bag they're carrying, and they just walk on by. But not me. I look at them and I say, I say, "Howdy, stranger. Can I give you a hand with that?" And you know who taught me to be that way? A guy called Ted Mosby. A guy who's uncynical and sincere and believed in things. And you know what, Ted? I believe that deep down, you're still that guy. I am still that guy. I think you want to go out there and get that girl. I want to get out there and get that girl. She seems nice. Because she seems nice! She does seem nice! You're right, Marshall. I gotta go get her. And I know exactly where she is. The wedding's in 15 minutes. I'll never make it! You can do it, Sensei. Go get love a house round kick. Right in the heart. You're right. What am I doing?! There's still time! Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosely To be your lawfully wedded husband, I - Royce! - Stella! - Ted?! - Tony? - Tony? - Ted? Barney? Look, there's something I need to say. A long time ago, A long time ago, I let this beautiful girl Stella I let a horrible girl named Stella Break my heart Get away And now she's with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and that movie is called The Wedding Bride. What are you saying? You can't talk to me like that! I'm Jed Mosely! I'm Ted Mosely! But Royce, this dufus in the red cowboy boots, this isn't me. So, just to be clear, are you saying you that you don't have a pair of red cowboy boots in your closet? - Barney what are you - I just wanted They're actually more of a burgundy. Royce, I promised Stella, I promised to make you some pancakes. To make you my wife. And I'd like to live up to that promise. Ted, all I've wanted all my life Ted, all I've wanted all week was your love. was some pancakes. Oh, go on, honey, kiss him! Kiss him. Kiss him, kiss him, Um, Uncle Barney didn't say "kiss". Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him, Still not saying "kiss. " Kiss him! Sir, you need to leave, now. This is outrageous. Who the kiss are you? Royce, if you still If you still truly love me kind of like me can you let me make you - My wedding bride? - Can you let me make you some pancakes? Can-do's-ville, babydoll. Daddy! Kiss this! Kissin' movie's over anyway. Sir Oh. Oops. Oops. Hey, um that stuff that happened to me, it was pretty rough. I'm, uh, I'm still getting over it. Let me help you with that. And just like that, kids, My baggage didn't seem quite so heavy anymore. You see, everyone's got some baggage-- it's part of life-- but like anything else, it's easier when someone gives you a hand with it. Wow, it feels so good to have told you all that stuff about me. I'm really glad I can open up to you. Ted, it's not that big of a deal. Heck, I've been left at the altar. Three times. The last time was because I blew all our money on online poker. That's why I live with my brother now. Wait, I I thought you said you had a tiny studio apartment. Just the two of us, You should see how he hogs the covers. Yeah, you gotta go. What's Barney been drinking? That girl was smoking hot Yes, I coulda nailed her But no it's not a failure Cause there's one thing she is not To score a 10 would be just fine But I'd rather be dressed to the nines! It's a truth you can't refute Nothing suits me like a suit Picture a world where all the boys and girls Are impeccably well-dressed That delivery guy in a jacket and tie That puppy in a double breast That 80's dude with mutton chops That baby with a lolly pop kinda Nothing suits 'em like a suit Suits! Wingman I can wear! Suits! They're oh, so debonair! Suits! The perfect way to snare A girl with daddy issues! Suits! In navy, blue or black! Check out this perfect rack! I want to give them a squeeze Oh Really? What would you do if you had to choose Between your suits and a pot of gold? Suits What would you say If you gave your suits away And in return you'd never grow old? Suits What would you pick? One million chicks Or a single three-piece suit? It's moot! What if world peace were within your reach— Alalalalalah- I'm gonna stop you right there. It's suits. Come on, Lily. Get your head out of your ass. Two! Three! Four! girls will come But there's only one absolute Every bro on the go needs to know that there's no accepted substitute I'm sorry, suits, let's make amends. My Sunday Best are my best friends! Send Casual Friday down the laundry chute! Cause nothing suits the, Undisputed, Oft-saluted Suitor of repute Like a.. Wait for it... Suit! The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing What up? I I can't. I just I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight. Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night? Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever! All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. That sucks. I've been there, buddy. What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in. With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric sex temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G. I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback. Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up. You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house? Of course not. It's a two-day job. Pass. Same. Unsubscribe. You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump. No one believes that story. You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us. So there we were helping Barney pack up his childhood home. Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box. Yeah, that's what your mom said. How dare you! No, she actually said that. Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there. Someone order something tall, dark and awesome? - James! - Bro! - How you doing? - Hey! - Oh, my goodness! - Mama. Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome. Mom. Stop. And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?  Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit? Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there. So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz. Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say? Oh, you know, how funny you are Guilty. Handsome. Who, me? Incredible lover. Really? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, "He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, "endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours" Blah, blah, blah. "Orgasms so intense that you just black out. " All that stuff. Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review? What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this. But that is not the point. undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, "It's the greatest movie ever. " You say, "Uh, it's pretty good"" And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, "Sweep the leg!" And Daniel-san's all like  Maybe I did oversell you a bit. Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff. Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?  I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids. That sounds plausible. Hey. It's true. Tell him, James. Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better. Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this "Dear Barney" I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. 00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General. Thank you. Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot? Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others. Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine? Oh, I don't know That guy. Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too? No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early. Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids. Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was "sick" and give him cough medicine until he passed out. I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4" in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped. And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa. Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down. I always find that reassuring. You will meet her, buddy. You think so? Yeah! Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids. Baby, it's Santa. 00 a. m. a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein. I'm not lying to our kids. Ah Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class. Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and home run king, Frank Aaron. Yeah, school girls The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't Who's Sam Gibbs? No idea. Why? Mom addressed this and never sent it. What's in it? Hey. It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote "Your son. " Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes? Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?  That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes? There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote "your son" on the back. Oh, no, that It says "Yourson. " For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes? If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background? I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way! Can you believe her? I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom! So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it. How? I sent her another email. "Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound "like I was trying to oversell Ted. "The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off. " Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure "Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. "But he's clean, "open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. "He's not bad at all. Not bad at all. " See, now you went too far in the other "I'll be honest. The first few times "aren't going to be that great. "He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant. " Stop! Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers. Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker. Barney! You You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father. I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too. Not now. This address isn't too far. So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy. You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world. Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes. Oh, what's done is done. "Ted Mosby is solid as a rock. " No. "Dependable. " No. "Rugged. " No. Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives? I just want to hit that perfect middle ground. How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? "Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, "and really rich, but lacks bladder control. " Oh, damn. What? That last bump just made me hit send. Oh, no. Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke. No, they won't. They're going to think Wait. "Everyone"?  "Really rich"? You ready for this? For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just just give me a second, okay? I thought you said that he Stop. Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really you know. I'm not crazy. I just I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up. Come here. Can I help you? Yeah you're Sam Gibbs. Yes. I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson in the '70s. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I I knew Loretta. My mother meant to send you this. You're my son. God, this must be so hard for Barney. Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today Papa!  Look at us! It's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera! That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well. Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you. Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father. He's also quite the detective. Don't worry. We'll We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back. Or, we could just let him have this one. What? Are you kidding? Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day? Here, Ted. Capture the moment! I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl. Man I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about. During that afternoon, Sam and James began to discover how much they had in common. Come on. You know this. Come on. There you go. Come on. - Weird day. Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great! I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her! Maybe a little. You said she was a ten. I did not specify on what scale. You said she looked like a movie star. She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear. Dad, look how fast I can run! He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son. I have a grandson? His name's Eli. He's beautiful. Eventually, the strangest afternoon of our lives wound to a close, and we headed back to Staten Island, where Barney and his mom had a long overdue heart-to-heart. Barney? I need to talk to you. Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top? Listen I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father. Are you sure? Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is. And at that moment, Barney suddenly saw his childhood more clearly than he ever had before. I'm sorry, but your son can't be on the team. He's terrible. What'd Coach say, Ma? He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard. Why didn't anyone come? Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. "Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize "for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. " Barney. It's okay, Mom. I don't need it. But it's your father. I already have a father. And his name is Loretta. Kids, your uncle Barney grew up without a dad. And it always made him feel incomplete. But as he hugged Loretta, so around by the boxes into his happy childhood, he realized he had one hell of a mom. Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping? Then one afternoon in 2010, I achieved that goal. Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia Brown, pointy, weird The one that really seems to stick is "unfinished. " Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever But first, let's back up a few days. Ted, look across the bar. one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong? I don't know. Got a burger coming. Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy. Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again. Hi. Barney Stinson. And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman. Thank you for your time. Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast. 00 News with Don Frank. Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay? Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure. That's great. Where's the poop, Robin? Excuse me? When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin? I don't know what you're talking about. Where's the poop, Robin? There's no poop. Where's the poop? Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure. there's a zit breaking out on your forehead. Finished with that. Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him. That's great. Thank you. Good on you. Where's the poop, Robin? Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an indelicate voice mail. I am gonna kill you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, kill you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the killing and eating your face thing. Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number. Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing. Prove it. Delete contact. There. Deleted. Back already. How was flying solo? And by "solo," I mean so low that you got shot down. Look, I didn't get shot down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase. I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that sex just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have sex with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her. The next day, at the university, I had a surprise visitor. What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail. No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this? It's my building. Kids, you may remember that, a few years earlier, I was chosen to design the new Manhattan headquarters for Goliath National Bank. It was the opportunity every architect dreams about. And when the project was ultimately scrapped it broke my heart. Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers Nay, bro-workers? Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building. This is awesome You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out. Actually, I think I'm gonna say no. No? Are you kidding me? But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream. I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall. Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single bullet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing. For all we know, that was the contractor's fault. But that won't happen on your watch you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level. Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be. I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings? Of course not. All right. Hey, Professor Mosby. Hey, Rachel. And I thought that was the end of the story. But then that night I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important. I need another drink. Marshall, you want anything? No, I'm fine. Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here? Wait, you turned down the job? When? This morning. That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job? Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl? Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you. Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me? I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together. I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney. Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl? Chrissy, I love your glasses. Really? They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy. The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem a proven winner. But Barney hasn't done Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted. Hey, Lily! Don't "Hey, Lily" me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway. Oh, no, not this again. Where's the poop, Robin? Okay, I left Don another message. "This just in" is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you. But that's impossible. You deleted his number. I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, "Are you sure?" And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone. Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it! It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever. I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it! Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it. My "plezh. " If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it. Super Kicks Karate. No, not that one. That's my dojo. You have a dojo? I took an introductory karate class. Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class? What's the matter, lady? You scared? Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher. I hated kindergarten. All three times. But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons. How long ago did you take that class? I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, "Wassuuuuuuup!" How do you even remember that? Wassuuuuuup! Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again. I might. No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay. No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky. I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now. For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth. No! Barney's been "putting the moves" on Ted. Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together. No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower. Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint? Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks! Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks! Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks! He did. And the intense eye contact thing? So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers? Okay. Yep. And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact? You know why jalapeño poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese. That is so true. Yeah Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it it balances out the spiciness of the jal the spiciness of the Dude! So at any point in this did you say, "Barney, I know what you're doing, "and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job"? Well, I mean, not exactly in those You're loving this. No. You are. You're loving the attention. It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did! Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building. I am not that kind of architect. So get this Robin never deleted Don's number. Wait Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours. Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight. Edwin. Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band you remember The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk. Funky. You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it. No, no, we're gonna we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and We're not going to play another gig again, are we? Probably not, baby. See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it? Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week. Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to. Okay. Your turn. Barney, I gotta tell you something. Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you? Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower. Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else. Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, "pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more. " It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, "Oh, God, I never should have said no. " It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying. Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves. It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job. I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't! - Okay, I'll do it! - What? Ted, it's too late. I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff. Wow, half? Ted, of behalf of Goliath National Bank Okay, it's a move. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman. You guys lied to me? You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here. I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch! Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me. We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job. No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women before me fell for. Wow, respect. No Ted you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me. Come on, Ted! This is your dream. No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no. Hey, guys. Where's the poop, Robin? How do you do that? You are like a bomb-sniffing dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog. I think that's just called a dog. Where's the poop, Robin? Fine. I called Don again. Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to kill you. No No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too. I thought you deleted his number. I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily. Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be  Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class? Why aren't you in class? Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract. Not so fast. I'm not that easy. And so I made Barney break his golden rule. I made him take me out to dinner before I finally gave him the thing he always got. Yes. 00 News with Don Frank. Bueno? Who is this? No hablo ingles. Quien es? I'm sorry. Is this 917-456 I'm sorry, 465 No, wait. Robin finally got some closure, too. Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that. Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job. I knew this day would come. Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet. No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face. Aw That's actually really sweet. Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom? Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no! That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now. Hey, get this. You know my friend Max from law school? He's at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown, and Woody Allen is sitting two tables over. He wants us to come check it out. I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen. What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker - and never have seen Woody Allen? - I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw Maury Povich. Kids, you know talk show host Maury Povich. It was uncanny how often we saw this guy. Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich. Maury Povich is everywhere. I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker until you've seen Woody Allen. I am, too, a real New Yorker. That's adorable. You're from Canada. I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat. A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it. I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do. No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks. No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've killed a cockroach with your bare hands. Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things. By the end of this day, Robin would have done all of those things. Okay, time's up. What are we talking about? Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him. Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday. Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes. A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three. Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5. The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus I can run faster than a bus. Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You're all wrong I got a way to get there so fast, I could beat all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first. How? Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay? - Oh, my God! - Oh, wow! All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! Doesn't matter how you get there! Stay sad! I'll be back! Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush. Kids, I should tell you, Lily really needed a win that day. When Marshall and Lily decided to have a baby, they assumed it would happen right away. It's gonna be positive. Eriksen man are hella fertile. When Uncle Morris was 16, he got his girlfriend pregnant just by holding her hand too tight in the backseat of a car. Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me. Negative. As the weeks went by, Marshall's confidence never wavered. Then it started to mess with Lily's head. Negative? Well, we know it's not me. Everything's fine. These things take time. Not with an Eriksen. Something must be wrong with you. Also, my mom hates you. You know what? Just to make sure, I'm gonna pee on this again. What? No, you wouldn't. Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Lily was so fed up with not getting anywhere, maybe winning this race was just what she needed. Idiot! I'll show them. My body can outrun any motorized vehicle. I'm like John Henry when he beat the steam engine. All I need is a great folk song. Gather round, ye children to hear the tale so sweet of a man who dared to race machines with nothing but his feet Suck it, grand-butt! Marshall versus the machines hyah! Ooh, taxi! Excuse me, I got a thing. Maury Maury Track maintenance? How do you do that? I grew up here, I speak conductor. Damn it! Damn it! Kids, I also needed a win that day. A couple nights earlier, your Uncle Marshall had offhandedly mentioned a web site called Grademyteacher. net? It's this awesome site where students can go say what they really think about their professors. Hey, you're probably on there. I just had to see what my students had written about me. And it was Majestic. Until Now, kids, I knew I was a good Professor. That's why I didn't let it bother me. I had nothing to prove. Absolutely nothing. Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there? - Oh. The brown one or the gray one? - That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18 Hey! Come on! Elizabeth! Somebody call an ambulance! Excuse me, I've got a thing. Hey! - That's my cab! - Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown. This is my cab! Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz. Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown. Oh, no. It's my cab! This is my cab! It's Barney. Help me. Robin also needed a win that day. It had been a rough year for Robin. First her boyfriend and former cohost, Don, left her for another job. Then Robin met her new cohost, Becky. Hi! I'm Becky! Hi. I am so excited to be your coanchor! Yay! Hi, Becky. My, you're perky. Don't worry, I am not here to step on your toesies. Oh You're still the star. I made chocolate chip cookies for everybody! Yay! And just like that, Becky started to eclipse Robin. I mean, literally eclipse her. This is my cab! Aah! Keep it. Hello. Ranjit, take me to Gregor's. Taking you to Gregor's. As Marshall ran with all his might and passed his friend Christine Hey, Christine. He thought of all the times that he had beaten the machine. He triumphed over "Pitfall" Yes! He vanquished the alarm Yes! He brought the jukebox back to life with his Fonzarelli arm - Hey! - Oh! Marshall versus the machines. Ow. Ow. Ow. Last seat. Thank God. I just had the worst cab ride of my life. Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. Ow. Ow. Ow. Hey, Ranjit, pull over. Pulling over. Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you. Hyah! Move along. Hyah! Move along. Hyah! See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning? I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I? Are you kidding me? Hey, Barney, can I talk to you? Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important. Oh, well, this This is something important. Um, I'm having a A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say "carrots and peas". Carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face. Look, I've spent the last six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me killed. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying. Robin, I had no idea. No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car. Stopping the car. No, don't stop the car. Not stopping the car. Seriously, stop the car. Seriously stopping the car. Look, you Wait, wait Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here. Carrots and peas. Don't You I'll crank up the smooth jazz. Our hero's strength was fading fast just as the light turned green. He then thought back to all the times he'd lost to a machine. Come on, Playboy channel. The cable box is fearsome Ow! But the stapler's mighty sting Come on, spice channel. The cable box's bite again Getting too tired to sing. Uses a hybrid steel tube structure Kids, that day, I had a horrible realization. If you can't spot the crazy person on the bus It's you. The good news is, I was halfway there, and nothing could stop me. Whoa! This is crazy. I can't believe it. Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar. Absolutely. Just like that, the race was back on. Idiot. Meanwhile, one subway car over Oh, God. Oh, bite me! Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win. And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group. Actually, Barney did not need a win. And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me. He did smell incredible. Stop! Too slow. Switch. Sweetie? Are you okay? No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over. You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in. What did he say? No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich? Hey! Lily. Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker. Bring it in. Damn it. Hey, it's Lily. Help me. And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep? Buddy? Hey, buddy? Need a hand? The machines have won! The machines have won. Dude, mellow. I can't do it. I can't run that far. I can't outrace anything. I I can't I can't get my wife pregnant! Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about? My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't. Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing. Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones. And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude. Sounds like you guys need to clear everything, subtract the negativity, and add some perspective. Marshall! Marshall, get in! Hello. There it is. Where are Marshall and lily? Who cares? I won? I won! No! I can't believe I won! How did that even happen? Here's how it happened. Okay, he's in. Go. Go. Gun it. Ted is in the way. Run him over. Running him over. No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you? Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me. Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted. Why did I get so crazy about this? Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet. Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me. It's only been two months. We are crazy. We're totally crazy. This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that? We gotta go back to Paris. And take ballroom dancing. And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge. And see Coney Island. I've still never been. See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do before we start having kids. Oh, a cradle list. I'm So glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited for when it happens, but this isn't a race. This isn't a race. Ranjit, screw Gregor's. Let's go to Coney Island. Screwing Gregor's. Going to Coney Island. I saw Barney notice Robin's face And maybe realize something. Barney says he tripped, but it sure felt like he tackled me on purpose. And when Robin won, i could have sworn I saw him smile. Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me. I'm not gonna - Not gonna - Smell me. He did smell incredible. Wait a minute. So, where is Woody Allen? He's right there. Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich. I always get those two confused. Technically, there was only one winner that day. And in that race, everyone found exactly what they needed. It's true, she wouldn't see Woody Allen for another couple months, but that's how Robin became, by just about any definition of the term A real New Yorker. I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch. Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together! Everything was going great. That is, right up until Barney said Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building. It was the site of The Arcadian, one of New York's grandest old hotels. In its heyday, it was the New York home to kings and queens. But lately mostly just queens. Hi, handsome. Lookin' for a date? Uh, no, thank you. Still got it. Barney, we have to talk. Sure. What's up? Excuse me, Mr. Stinson. Not now, Trish! But there's an urgent memo for Mr. Mosby. "Dary. " Legendary! So, what's on your mind? I can't design the building. Oh, yeah. Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube. Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction. Traction? As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm. Please stop calling yourself "Papa. " And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats. Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night. Kids, as you may remember, Max was a friend of Marshall's from law school with whom Robin was really starting to hit it off. Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness. Yeah. He's a sweet guy. She feels really comfortable with him. They bonded over hockey. I guess he has a small penis, but they want to double-date next weekend. Why would you tell me that? So you'll clear your schedule. No! The other part! Oh, the small penis thing? Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him "Max. " That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small penis Just don't! You're kidding me. I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave? Snakes. Did you just say "snakes"? I don't recall saying "snakes"" Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. New is always better. New is always better? You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better. Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything? Everything. So, those new Star Wars movies Those are better than the old ones? Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law. And when you're at a Guns n' Roses concert, you're like, "Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy"? Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted. Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch? Glenmckenna, aged 30 years in oak casks. Amazing. And what's your newest scotch? Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch. Don't let it touch your skin. Your call, buddy. A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better! Pfft. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. "Hey, look how big my cell phone is!" You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy. Lily told you. Told him what? Max has a small penis. How can you speak of such things? Girls talk about everything. Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming How can you speak of such things? You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, "Boobs?" Not the complete sentence, "Does she have big boobs?" Which also would not be great. "Boobs?" I do not do that. My friend Lori from work Boobs? Damn it. But seriously. Boobs? So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small penis I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened. Impossible. Max's penis is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter. Speaking of disappointing weenies Ted, tell them what you told me I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building. I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin Wait a minute. Who's the girl? - Duh. What? I There's no g-girl. Why would you even Her name is Zoey. Boobs? Beautiful building, right? Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow. Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream! Whose dream? We wound up talking for hours. I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history. Old is always better. I can't wait to be old. Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines. You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused. You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly. Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait. That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tranny before, but it's still sweet. Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and beat you with it. Hey, Ted, can I ask you something? Anything. Will you sign this petition? "Save The Arcadian"" We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us? And you said? Where do I sign? Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously Boobs? This isn't about the girl. It's about the building. And what did this "Zoey" say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction? Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert. Well Uh, it's a it's a funny thing about that So what do you do, Ted? I'm a veterinarian. What? I panicked! This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl. I don't do that. Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel! Look, she's really hot, okay? Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid. Asian girls love them some Jews. And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily. Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief. And you're welcome. The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian? No. Technically, they were eggs. Did you just say "eggs"? I don't recall saying "eggs. " So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, "Holy crap, I'm about to quit"" Small penis. You have a small penis. Oh, that's super interesting, but you have a small penis. Damn it, Marshall! Okay. Okay. Think of any two words other than "small" or "penis. small penis. Damn it! Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm. Well, right now it's a pretty small practice. Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small. Bro, it's pretty small. Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? "The motion of the ocean. " That whole thing. He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on. I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick. Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff. Let's order! As I was mustering the courage to call Zoey and tell her my true identity Zoey I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool. the strangest thing happened. I need your help. Just to warn you. What I'm about to show you is not a hundred percent legal. Wasn't expecting bunnies. I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, "Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay. " Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that? Well, I know what I'm getting. Oh? Oh? The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge. Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy. Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. I'll be right back. All right. We'll just be here. You're great. Ah. Thanks, bro. It's, uh. it's going on a while. I know. Thanks. Damn, baby, be cool! You're acting like he has six months to live. It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk! Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk? Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room? Hey. Hey. It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out. Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about sex? Yes, we do, but you know what we say? "I hit that. " "I got some. " "I tapped it. " "I squeezed those. " Discreet and efficient. Not to mention classy. Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our sex life, I'd probably kill myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her? Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you! Are you sure? Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever. You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested? Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy. Wow. You're a little bit crazy. Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, or even buildings get screwed over. I'm certainly not going to just sit by while GNB turns The Arcadian into a soulless metal box. Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down. Cuckoo! Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?! Solid C-cup, perky bounce. Momentary grudging respect. Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building. Ted, that is never gonna happen. Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project. Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana. Oh, bummer! Hey. Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came. Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with "Save The Arcadian. " Great. I'll grab you a picket sign. Hmm. Do you want "GNB puts the douche in fiduciary. . 20 somewhere"? Dudes, you forgot your signs! As I looked up at that magnificent old structure, I realized I wasn't letting my feelings for Zoey mislead me. This building really was worth saving. Ted, everything okay? Yea um um You work for GNB? Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard? She was really hot, okay? How the hell could you do that? Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door. The billboard, Barney. I had to. Now that you have no shot with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal. You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting. Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump! Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?! Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail. You named the rabbit? You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it. You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want. So you're back in? Yeah. That night, as I worked on a new design that just might solve all my problems Marshall was visited by a disturbing vision. Ugh, he thinks I like this But it feels disgusting. Uh, it looks disgusting. Um Uh, is this working for you? "Uh, is this working for you?" Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men? Oh, you're bad. More Cosmos? Mm. I can't I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin! Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things. Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that. Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard. Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters? Kids, it was one of those moments in life where everything comes together the girl, the building, everything, until Are you married? Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved? This isn't about the girl. It's about the building. Yeah, it was about the girl. Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing? This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes. Snakes? I don't recall saying snakes. Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, "I can't do this," and storms out. Wow, that is weird. But here's the crazier part. No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin about this! It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud. Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh? Yup. "'You're like a Greek god,' I moaned, as the" I can't read that, baby. "Musky scent of man. " "As the musky scent of man "and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me. " That sounds real. And as for Zoey, it was funny. I'd lied to her, then completely let her down. And I barely knew the girl. But there was something about her. I couldn't help but wonder if I'd ever see her again. Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire! Why, yes. Yes, I would see her again. Hey. Hey. Hey. How's it going with Robin? Uh, I think I have to break up with her. Really? Why? You with her? Yeah, well, there's this kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom. Hey, what's not for everyone? Guys, come on. What is it? Come on, bro. This is a locker room. I What do you think it was, Murray? Now, I hate to stop while I'm on a roll, but happy Halloween, ya crazies!  Hey, Professor Brosby, you gonna come get beers with us later? Nah, I got a thing. But you kids have fun trick or treating. This is a treat. You're the coolest, Professor Mosby. Well, hot dog. Did it hurt? What? Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass. It's not her nose that's in my ass, Lily, it's her heart. My class loves me; I-I'm really making an impression on those guys. I'd like to make impression on those guys. Man, I love the office Halloween party. It is so much sluttier than the office Christmas party. Though not as freaky as the office President's Day Rave. Or the office Tu B'Shvat Pajama Jammy-Jam. Hey, guys. Hey, Boss. Hey, Randy. Uh, you want a beer? Oh, no, thank you. I brew my own. At the risk of bragging, my Hazelnut Pilsner won fourth prize at the Weehawken Retirement Home Clam Bake and Wheelchair Maintenance Picnic. I wouldn't consider any part of that bragging. Hey, it just occurred to me, is your friend-- what's her name?-- Garbin, Flabin Robin? Robin. That's it, yeah. Is she gonna be here? Oh, not that I really care. Robin has another party to go to. No! Damn it! I'm leaving. But she might stop by later. I guess I can hang out a little longer. Oh, we were big fans of New York's annual Halloween parade. I don't mean the one that takes place Halloween night in the Village. I mean the one that takes place the morning of November 1st-- the Annual Post Halloween Walk of Shame Parade. Look at them heading home after their dirty, filthy hookups. Looks like that bee got busy. Looks like that French maid didn't turn down somebody's bed. Oh, looks like Pocahontas has a couple of wounded knees. Come on, Marshall. That's a line. No, it's because of the We get it. Does it get any better than this? Uh, yes. Yes, it does. Crap. How I Met Your Mother 6x07 ♪ Canning Randy Original Air Date on November 1, 2010 There she is-- Florence Night-In-Bed-With-A-Stranger. So, who's the lucky patient? I don't want to talk about it. Please tell me you're not hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. My co-anchor's a woman. Please tell me you are hooking up with one of your co-anchors again. Robin had always believed that the key to success was intelligence, hard work and professionalism. Her new co-anchor Becky had a different philosophy. It's the Farhampton Boat Show! Boats! Boats! Boats! Remember 5th, 6th and 7th at the Farhampton Civic Center. Boats! Boats! Boats! Come on down. B-B-B-Boats! You did a commercial? Why not? You're a journalist! Don't you want to be taken seriously? No. I'm cute. Okay, well, if you really think this is going to help your image. Hi, Becky. Boats, boats, boats! Robin, a little help here? Aw Oh Robin, you gotta not worry so much about being liked. Oh, easy for you to say. Everybody loves you at your job. Mm. That was true of my teaching job. But I was also designing the new headquarters for Goliath National Bank, and well Ted Mosby, we don't like you! What do you have to say for yourself, tearing down a beautiful, old building just to put up a stupid band headquarters? Hmm Boo freakin' hoo. Boo freakin' hoo? That's it? The Arcadian is an architecturally significant Architecturally significant?! Zoey, you're very pretty. Your hair smells great. Shampoo. You should try it sometime. You don't know the first thing about architecture. Key Ted Mosby's car. Go on. I'm a professor, okay? I teach this stuff at one of the best colleges in the country. I don't go down to your place of non-employment and lecture you about how your little protest is a misguided waste of time, except whoops, I just did. Ha-burn. Oh, good, the eggs are here. Well, I should head up. No, GNB was not popular. That's why every year they produced a feel-good video to improve the bank's image. What makes Goliath National Bank different from other big banks? Here at GNB, we care. I care about our precious Earth. I care about old people. I care about high-yield offshore investments. And so does Tugboat here. Isn't that right, Tugboat? Yeah. Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet. All you have to do is say "I care about making dreams come true. " First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so. Everyone is in this video. Randy's in the video. I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice. Wait. Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown? I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that? They never arrived at the downtown office. They Well, just to make sure we're on the same page, is "send them downtown" not an expression for shredding a document? You shredded them?! Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from. That's not an expression! That has never been an expression! Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project. There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him. Okay, that, that right there. That attitude is exactly why I won't be in your video. Because GNB doesn't care. They hand out pink slips like they're hors d'oevres. Just last week, I was talking to Arthur Oh, whoa, you're wearing a green tie now. I'm wearing a green tie. GNB treats people like they're disposable, and I will not be a part of that. Marshall Eriksen does not fire people, period. Uh, just want you to know, we are making good progress on this new project. Oh, you gentlemen keep talking, I will answer that. Marshall Eriksen's office. Yeah, I can get that for you. Just a second. Uh bank. The "B" stands for bank. Okay, Mother, I'll see you tonight. Oh, yikes. I'd better get Mr. Messy a napkin. Period. Just tell me who you slept with! Lily, I don't want to get into it, okay? Aha, it's someone we know. If it was some ding dong we didn't know, you'd just give me his name. Fine. It's Bill Pepper. Bill Pepper? Mm-hmm. Kind of a coincidence there happens to be a bill and a pepper shaker here on the table. Any chance you and Bill had a three-way with Fork Napkin? Oh It's someone we know! So, I'm assuming you all read the chapters on the Greek Revival architecture. Any questions? Yes. How do you sleep at night? What are you doing here? It was recently made clear to me that I don't know the first thing about architecture, so here I am. Very well, then, let's get started. Some examples of Greek Revival architecture Ooh! Ooh! Is The Arcadian Greek Revival? No. What's The Arcadian? Oh, it's just this beautiful, old building that Professor Mosby wants to tear down. What?! No, Professor Mosby loves old buildings. He wouldn't do that. Right, Ted? Getting back to Greek Revival I lost them. Look, you're new at teaching. In my kindergarten class, I have had plenty of troublesome students. Like Johnny Marley  Johnny? Johnny! He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell. But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers. You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside? The one with the really annoying alarm?  We're familiar with it. Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class  Shuts them right up. Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way. I'll just give them more candy and make them a mix CD. Problem solved. Oh, baby, what's wrong? Something bad happened. Randy, hey, have you seen the Before you get to that, regarding the earlier project I was working on Voilà! That's the Hermanson contract? The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No Anyway, what's your thing? I need the Filbert contract! No!! Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent. Sorry, Randy, but this just isn't working out. Marshall popped his cherry!  Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment. You slept with Randy! What?! Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson. Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, "Boats! Boats! Boats!" So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember Randy has a unique condition. Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet. Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry. That's exactly what happened. See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better. Randy, hey, what's going on? I just wanted to say no hard feelings. Thank you. So where you headed now? Downtown. No!!  It's okay, baby. It wasn't okay. So the next morning Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday. That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago. No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say "GNB Cares," and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes, but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you? No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down. Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed. Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should we should help them. We should nurture them. Oh I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't. Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay? A piece of New York history is being torn down, and all you could say was "Boo freakin' hoo"? Boo freakin' I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack. The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in? Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty? No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed. They were all turning against me, so I figured, what the hell. And did it work? Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side. Hey, guys. Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy murdered him. No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin. Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower? I'm trying to eat here, buddy. No. Because you slept with her on Halloween. What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed. You didn't sleep with her? No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging. So why are you smiling? I'll tell you why. This just isn't working out. I'm fired. Great. This is the candle kiosk at the mall all over again. Wait a minute. I can get a severance check. If I don't shred it, I can use that money to start my own brewery. Imagine a beer with my name on it. Randy Wharmpiss, this is the best day of your life. Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss. No! Good morning, everybody Where's my class?  Hello, Professor. Ha-boom. I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy. But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A a hopsmeister! Well, then quit. No one's stopping you. I-I can't. I need my severance check. Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud. It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it. Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that. Marshall, what a memorable talk we had yesterday. Randy, on behalf of everyone at GNB, both in and out of prison, we're sorry. And I want to assure you you will never be fired again. You're going to work here until you die, huh? Huh? Green tie?  Nice choice. Thanks. It brings out my eyes. Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes. Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever. Oh, we'll see about that. Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. "We care about making dreams come true," in three, two No! What are you doing? Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I. D. No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy. And there's more. I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff. Now am I fired? I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages. I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee. Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine. Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life. That's just the pick-me-up I needed. Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?  Hello. It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again? You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers I like my teachers. are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley. Was there more to that story? A little bit. Lily, you're a psychopath. A little bit. Oh, a panda! I thought about Lily's advice. And I figured fear was worth a try. Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us? Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an "F. " You said that? Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought "F" had a nice, scary ring to it. Right? Yeah. Hey, guys. Hey. Robin, who'd you sleep with? I told you-- Randy. He was a machine. Where's the poop, Robin?  Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial. Bladder trouble-- it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone. I'm going to the bathroom right now. Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone. Say "Ah"  Wow! I can't wait to see it. Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it. It ran for seven years. Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream-- big-time lawyer at a huge corporation. You think working here is my dream? Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk. Randy. This is delicious. You're fired. Kids, the next morning-- my class had the highest attendance it had ever had. And not long after that, Randy used his severance money to start a little brewery. Now you can have a Wharmpiss at every bar in America. And all because I care about making dreams come true. Yep. That's a wrap. So, have you guys landed on a name yet? We're trying, but it's tougher than you think. You see, I like "Tiffany. " And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name. That's my mother's name. I know. Oh, I got it. How 'bout we name the baby after you-- "Frigid Shrew. " Oh, that's good. No, no, no, no. Let's call her "Vodka. " Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go! Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it. Stuart, you are so That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby? Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a Emily. Lisa. Lisa?! Emily?!  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. number one I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid "LeBron," and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop. Then I'm also crossing off, um, "Shaquille" Mm-hmm. "Hakeem," and "Dikembe. " Hey, what about "Rob"? "Rob"? No. Why not? Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey? Honka, honka!  Not "Rob. Ooh. Not "Ryan. " "Johnny?" Hey, where's the goldfish?  Not "Johnny. " Or "Gil. "  "Jeremy. "  Jeremy, no! Definitely not "Jeremy. " His stuff was so derivative. Well, I mean, geez, Lily. Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby "Becky," right? Why? What? What? Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show? Oh, honey, I really try. Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program. Mm-hmm. I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how "awful" Becky is, so last night I checked it out. Peace talks in the region have been described as, "productive. Last night, in Staten Island, a taco cart owner was robbed at gunpoint. Aww That's so sad. Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we Oh, no! They stole all his money and then pelted him with his own taco meat! Who would do that? Well, if you read the story, we might find out. Oh, can I do this one, about the horse? I love horseys. Mm-hmm. Aww, the horse died. Guys! This news is all really sad. Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky? Mmm  I thought she was charming. You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men? You want the long version or the short version? Short version. Short version. Who's your daddy?  You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy. No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily Who's your daddy?  Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter. No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy. Wow. That is disgusting. Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy. Challenge accepted. No. I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Okay. Here's my list of baby names. Oh. What about "Tara"? No. Not "Tara. " Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her. We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her We wrote songs about her. Tara, your booty is so smooth ♪ And I hope this isn't rude ♪ But I want to get up on it. ♪ Not "Tara. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Coming up on the main stage, give it up for Esther! Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. 30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance. Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Give it up for Esther!  Not "Esther. " I need a drink. Ted? Ted? Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right? Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther-- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads? Marshall's daughter ♪ Your booty ♪ Your booty's so smooth. Gentlemen, gentlemen. On the main stage, give it up for Marshall's daughter. He screwed up my childhood. That's why I do this. I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some Oh, God. Papa, I want you to meet my new boyfriend. Hey, bro. Thanks for making such a hottie. Who's your daddy? You are, 'cause of all the sex we have. I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy. It's not what it sounds like, folks. Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. Oh, okay, um You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit? How's this? Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect. What's up, shooter? Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys. Oh, well, that was just dumb luck. Hey, honey, would you get me a brewski from out of the shed? Sure. You want anything, Marshall? I'm in a computer, Mom. Oh. Yeah, all boys. Total co-winky-dink. It was no co-winky-dink. Since the Viking age, the Eriksen men have passed down ancient secrets for conceiving boys. Number one, avoid lemons. They're baby girl fertilizer. "I doubt there's any scientific data to support. . "" I had all sons. Your grandfather had all sons. Your great-grandfather had all sons. Scoreboard! Who you gonna listen to? Me? Or "scientific data"? Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re-- What? Ask me what I did yesterday. Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday. Lighten up, Robin. What'd you do, sweetheart? Mike! Well, I'm new in town and don't know many people. But yesterday, I met the sweetest man, who took me on a tour of the city. Guys, New York is kind of cool. Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the shot? Fantastic. Then this cutie patootie took me to this bar called MacLaren's, right underneath his apartment. Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby? Yes! Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate. I saw her bedroom. She's a messy Bessie. In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat. Ow! Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl? Not what it sounds like, folks. Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl? It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you. I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies. But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears. she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man. I don't know if that's totally true. It's okay, little darlin'. Poor spider. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow. Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom. Wait. Yeah, I slept. I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies. Wow, lady. You got some tig ol' bitties!  Gosh! Your body's a perfect this many. Hi. Do you want to wrestle with our special bathing suit places? Come on! Mm, I just need two seconds, baby. I know you think that's a compliment, but I'd rather you took your time. No, um I'll be right back. Ancient Norse wisdom tells us that, to sire a son, you must do three things right before you lay with your maiden. First, eat pickled herring. Eat it! This is ridiculous. Gentlemen, gentlemen, on the main stage, throwing her life away, give it up for Marshall's daughter!  Who's your granddaddy? That guy. Hey, want to have a three-way with me and my imaginary friend? His name's Otis. Hey, hey, want to come to my house and play telephone? I got the string; you got the cans. I wet myself! Will you change me? Can't blame her on that one. Guys I have some terrible, terrible news. I, Barney Stinson, can't pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy. Challenge forfeited. Yeah, we don't care about this No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge. I'm sorry. Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing. Challenge accept  Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid. Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak knife without supervision. For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed. Needed?  She makes training wheels feel needed. Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you. You two and your football. Okay. Mm-hmm. When we were dating, I I didn't make you feel needed? Come on! You always took charge of everything. Oop. I got this. Thanks. This okay? Am I hurting y I got this. Whoa!  Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops. I got this. Did that really bother you? Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. It's Becky. Aw, she's trapped in a revolving door. I got this. Yeah. Let's make a baby! Mm, mm, mm, mm! Whoa! Baby, you're packing snowballs, and your breath smells like a mermaid fart. Loving the dirty talk-- but you know what's even hotter? If we face this-a-way. Ooh, we're bad. Wait hey, baby, why are you facing me north?  You're trying to make us have a boy. I can ex How do you know about the north thing? Um, um And what are you doing with those lemons? Baby girl fertilizer! You're trying to make us have a girl! You are trying to make us have a girl. All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled "how to make a girl"-- some really weird stuff came up-- but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception eat a lemon  and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees. Ooh ah Oh, that's not bad. Eriksen! Lily, how could you do exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one. See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys. Oh, really. in unison. Oh, well, what about Chucky? Okay, A) He was a doll; B) He was possessed by an adult serial killer; and C) How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?  Hey. Hey. Hey. Um, when we were dating, did did I make you feel needed? No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all. That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry. Wait, where are you That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say "Who's your daddy?" to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a shotgun blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most amazing, strong independent woman I've ever banged. Thanks, Barney. You know, um there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so here goes. Someone naughty left his toys on the floor and needs to be spanked on his tushy-tush. Uh-oh, I'm in "twubble. " You did it? How? Last night, after admitting defeat, I just let myself go. Mmm, that looks so good. Can I have some? No! It's my ice cream; you can't have any. Someone needs to teach you how to share. Who's your mommy? Challenge completed!  Now, uh, can you get this freak out of here? I'm really scared. I got this. Uh, well, the other night she ran a really high fever. 00 in the morning, but they wouldn't admit her without a name. Right then and there, we realized how stupid we were being. We looked at each other and, well, we just knew. Our baby's name is Esther. Esther. Esther! That's beautiful. Yeah. We're idiots. Baby, names and gender, it's just, like it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound-- Whoa. Ten-pound? Eight-pound?  I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my vagina can't cash. I love you. And I'm gonna love the crap out of whatever baby we have. Me, too. You know what? We should just think of a name that's good for either a girl or a boy. Like, um Jamie. Jamie. Marshall we just named our baby. Jamie. Mmm Mmm Not Jamie. Shoe's untied. I got it. Yeah, this is over. Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day. Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Hmm. Cervical mucus. Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary. Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth. They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray. Look at this crib. But all in all, it wasn't a problem. That is, until the night of Barney's boutonniere. Oh, you're wearing a flower. Thank you. Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed. I know. Isn't it? Why are you wearing that? Why does Barney do anything ever? Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Hmm. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Mm-hmm. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The "everyday boutonniere" by Stinson. And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car. Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh. Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for "bootie is near?" Hmm. True story. Une histoire vraie. Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for "sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid"" Woman, you best check yourself. Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so Madam that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction! What, are we gonna duel? No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all! Kids, by this point, we knew Aunt Robin had been a teen pop sensation in Canada, known as Robin Sparkles. And we also knew that her Robin Sparkles character came from a Canadian TV show, which we'd never seen until now. I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD! Oh, you haven't watched it yet? No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about. Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once. Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday? Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying. Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying. Okay. Space Teens?! Is this a porno? No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show. Oh. Yeah! Yeah! I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of porn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assume you're about to make sweet love to? Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life. Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily. Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay? Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about What exactly is this about? Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math. That sounds ridiculous. So sue me. Like the producers of Milky Way Mathletes tried to. Great job using long division to catch that space burglar, eh? Well, what can I say? He'll be in galactic jail for the remainder of his life. Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh. Brace for turbulence! Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia. Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um You can't do that on television. Exactly. No. You can't do that on television! Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees. It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy-- he wasn't that great. I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand. You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child? Innocence of a child. Innocence of a child. Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six? Oh. 30. Yes! Oh! Seven times four? Eight times nine? Don't stop now! Almost there! Oh I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me? Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her? Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore. But BFFs are forever. Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends. I'm still friends with Punchy. Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends. Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe. Schmosby! Punchy! Schmosby! Punchy! Schmosby! Punchy! Schmoosby! Punchy! Hey, good talking to you, Ted. Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York. Definitely. We are just two peas. I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that. Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go. Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica? Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is? Four years, three months. Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends. Of course. Robin hates kids. The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat. Thus, if I may When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, "To hell with this, I'm outta hare. " Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her. Oh. Oh, got Wow. That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil? Robin's gonna dump me! Oh, sweetheart. Aha. When a second uterus plumped becomes Dude. Feel the room. No. We've been waiting all day! Just watch it without me. Two dudes on the couch together watching porn? That's kind of weird. Okay, it's not porn, it's a kids' show. Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse. Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off. We I'm serious. Hey Jessica, how's your beaver? Great. How's your beaver? Busy as ever! Our characters had pet beavers. Sure. The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot. It's a noble creature. Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers? Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable! No arguments here. 'Sup Shmosby! Punchy, what are you doing here? Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds? Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying? In your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch. Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here? I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those? Look, look, Punchy's here. Yeah, yeah. Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable! Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable! Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years. Don't care. He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life. Get a hotel. Robin LeBron. Okay, one night. Got to go. Hey. Where are you going? We just got here. Oh, a Korean massage. By yourself? Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect. Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter. Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened. Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember? Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies. I don't. Lily, how old am I? 384 months. Busted! Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies. So Lily did just that. She tried not to talk about babies. Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib? Crib What's the matter? You look rattled. Rattled? I want to talk about babies. What? Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet. What's that supposed to mean? It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it! Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done. Great. Great. For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin? I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other. Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you "accidentally" shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants. No! Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this. I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me? You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry. Okay. Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it. Times Square's the bomb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards. Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square? No. Times Square's the bomb! Here. You know what? Hold this, okay? I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley. Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, "You are the weakest link. Goodbye. " Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped. Okay, yeah. I know. You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen. Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley. That's your scrotum. You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that. Yeah, he's gotta go. What are we doing in Madison Square Garden? Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?! How did you find Glitter? Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them His friend Barney looked me up, hoping to buy my Space Teens costume. Yo, Glitter Be cool. So, is this the one who's best friends with Robin now? More like ex-best friends. Just like you. I'm sorry to hear that. I miss Robin. Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so Oh, Robin didn't stop being friends with me. I stopped being friends with her. What? Why? Because I had a baby. Honey, when you have a baby, all that best friend stuff-- hockey, bow hunting for caribou, math-- that all goes out the window. I mean, I tried to stay friends with her, but it just didn't happen. She took it pretty hard. I even thought she might try to kill herself. Charge! Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold. Didn't you do the same thing? Minus the baby? Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority. Be careful, Lily. I made those promises, too. And now I haven't even talked to her in five years. Sure, I thought about picking up the phone and calling her a hundred times, but I just never have the courage to actually Hey. Go ahead. Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here? Punchy, it's time to go back. Back to Times Square?! Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland. I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted. You worry about me? Yeah. The other day, when you called Schmosby! Punchy! Hey, good talking to you, Ted. Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York Definitely. Sweetie, who was that? It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed. Is this the Ted who got left at the altar? Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer. Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick. You think that would work? Worked on me. Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy. She's my angel. In fact, uh We're getting married. Wow! Wow! That's-- I'm-I'm really happy for you. Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man. Of course I will. Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Dawg pound. Oh, that's it That night, Lily went to the one place she knew she could find Robin-- New York's premiere Canadian bar, the Hoser Hut. Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology. No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby-- I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies. Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything. Oh Aww. I'm so happy you guys made up. Me, too. Where do I know this song from? Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Wow. This is so dirty. Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship. Yeah, dude, come on. Two beavers are better than one. Two beavers are better than one. Nice! Where'd you get this? Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you. And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church. Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous? What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous? Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous. It's a sad day in New York, Ted. A sad day, indeed. Do you know what I saw on my way in here? A girl In a sweater. And you know what that means. The season of exposed skin is over. Exactly. Gone are the tank tops, Ted. Gone are the cute little skirts. Gone are the sun dresses. The sun dresses, Ted! I don't think I can make it another eight months with no sun dresses. Barney, I really I have to grade these papers. I'm sorry. I'll let you work. What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire? A sun dress. Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight? I really have to get this done. Of course, of course. Thank you. "Sun dress," by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock Okay, I'll tell you. Just There's a There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look! I want to see a pretty girl. Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once. I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word. And what's that word? - Dibs! - What You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point. You never called dibs. Dibs were implied. Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652 The SS Dibs was lost at sea Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court. And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer! Damn it! Where is Marshall anyway? Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family. Tonight was their first at-bat. Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles? Check. Music to set the mood? Check. Music for when we're actually doing it? Check. You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her. Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. When I step up to make my toast as your best man Actually, Marshall would probably be As your best man Ladies and Gentlemen I had dibs. No! What? Tell me this isn't true. I had implied dibs. You know, you've humiliated me! I had no idea. You have to know that. You're the victim here. We both are. Let's get out of here. Or, you know, we could just do it right here. We could just do it right here. Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book. Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny. That is not what "shields up" looks like. That is what "shields up" looks like. Move. God! Hey. 'Sup, dudes? Fries? Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace. No fries for this guy. Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now. You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup. With hygiene? No, with Don. A few months earlier Here, have some tea. Thanks. Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need. Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no. Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important. Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out. Okay, I'm ready to have sex now. It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's Is this a Cheeto? No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs. Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you. Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up? Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a "de-rection. " Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet? Nope! Okay, so, here's what happened. I was at home, waiting for Marshall. Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall! Marshall, whoa! Wait. A big package just arrived. Yeah, it did. No, no. It's a real package from your dad. Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is. Marshall, look! A bassinet? Oh, my He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily? You told your dad we're trying to have a baby? Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend. Lily, we have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you. I have read 11 books on conception. I have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar. I take my temperature every hour. But good for you for not playing with yourself. I feel you, buddy. Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously. Okay, I'm better now. Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me? Excuse me? Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. But I Can I go smell her first? - No. All right. Wish me luck. Now kids, remember how I told you about a girl named Cindy? How I went on one date with her and it ended Get out. badly? Well How are you? Good. What the hell are you doing? That girl she's talking to? I dated her. Oh, that sucks! And dibs. So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms? Oh, hi Cindy! Oh, hi Cindy. Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted? Then I remembered. Cindy had a roommate. A roommate I only caught a glimpse of But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special. Was it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle? I got to see her ankles. You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo? Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office? Shannon? Start the music. Can you dig it?! Take it to the hole, Eriksen! Sink that putt, big fuzz! Put a pillow under her lower back. It helps facilitate conception, bro! I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad. Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings Hello. Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I noticed you hadn't changed your last name yet. No, I'm gonna So, don't worry. I called the DMV, I called your Amex, I got that process started for you. Hello. Lily, Marvin Eriksen. I understand you and Marshall have been fighting. Well, let me tell you what works for me and the missus. Frilly French undies and a box of wine. Hello. You might want to try pickles on that sandwich. Pickles would have helped that sandwich! The man has no boundaries. And I just can't procreate under these conditions! Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done. So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby. Okay, so you just You want me to give my dad a stroke? Only if you want to give this a stroke. That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think! They're talking to a guy now. What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy? Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry. Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt. Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos? Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous. Jealous? Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it. I have not lost it. You lost it. I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want. Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway. But it's all downhill from here. I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this. Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby? That's about the size of it. Okay, out of curiosity, when do we tell him about the baby? We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about. So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, "I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months. " Out for three months? Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this. No, we didn't. I meant, me and my dad. You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad? Oh, okay, Lily. Why don't you have a baby with your butt? What? I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go! Ted? Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me? Hi, Ted! Yeah, she definitely saw you. Can I see you for a minute in private? Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her. Okay, will do. And dibs. Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right? Oh, you don't want my opinion on that. Why not? If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him. That was really Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing! Brief. No. Lily, look. You saucy little minx. You sundressed up. Hi. some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I still got it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way. Robin, you do look super hot. Oh, do I? Yeah, you do. Thanks. rage, fury, a possible shanking. Thank you, Ted. After things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while. But then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. I feel like I should make it up to you somehow. You know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer. I should get back. Totally. Come say good-bye before you leave. Say good-bye before you leave? Her words exactly. Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six! She didn't see us high-six, did she? No. Good. That was pretty lame. Yeah, let's never do that again. Marshall? What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over? - Here's the thing. Hold on. Just It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad. Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go? Dad, this is Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back? Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now. Did it feel like a boy? You can tell. He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just He's so enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that? You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure. Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit. What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you? Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode All right. I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck. Kids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move. When you just put it all on the line and go for it. And that night, by golly, Cindy went for it. So no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother. She ended up being someone else's mother. In fact, they both did. Like I said, she's here on a date. So that was not the day I met your mother. The day I met your mother was the day of a wedding. Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous. Dude, it's just a wedding toast. I know. I just I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great. It will be. Best man? You're being summoned. Geez, what now? Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's Okay, and it's raining. Yeah. You were saying? You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you? No. I didn't bring an umbrella. I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right? No! Of course! Absolutely! You remember Zoey. Key Ted Mosby's car. The Arcadian. And as if that wasn't bad enough, the piece ran on a Saturday, which as you both know, is Dad's crossword day. She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a "fat cat. " Me and my "fat-cat friends. " We're not fat cats. Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie? Impeccable, old bean. To industry! Ah, bully! Okay, that night we weren't entirely un-fat-catty. You see, every year the Natural History Museum holds its Autumn Spectacular. It's attended by some of the most powerful and important people in New York. And, thanks to Goliath National Bank us. Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this? They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs. Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell? Oh. Nice monkey suit, Russell. Yeah. Come on, guys. Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend. Yeah. Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral. I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts. Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby? Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day. Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack. Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock. Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope. Ooh. Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale. Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling? I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, "Don't touch anything"" To a kid. That's like someone telling us, "Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers. " Ooh. Not bad. So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in. Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen. It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh? Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot. But you can, and should, call me The Captain. The Captain? The Captain? Back in school we met during a production of Guys and Dolls. The Captain was Nathan Detroit to my assistant stage manager. Marshall and Barney here, are the future of Goliath National Bank. Well, ahoy. Ahoy. Ahoy, The Captain. The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig. Please, enjoy yourselves, have fun, but don't touch anything. Thank you, The Captain. Challenge accepted. Wow. "The future of Goliath National Bank"? I know, it's so, uh You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract. Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too. So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause I think I'm going to say yes. Ah, that's the stuff. I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles. Impressive. Try this on for size. You want to dance? Let's dance. I live for the dance. Get your other hand off my ass. Sorry, sorry. What do you mean, you're going to say yes? I-I want to keep working at GNB. If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. Diarrhea. Right? Right? But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB. Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class. Poo-poo. Poo-poo platter. Zoey? Well, well, well. You have got to be kidding me. So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax? And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first? Darling, there you are. Hi. Hi. Ted, this is my husband. Yeah, old stuff's great. Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink? This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing. You're right. Want to go touch a bunch of stuff? Yeah, I do. So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway? Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name. Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. This is Ted. Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat. The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain. Well, she's an 85-foot sloop. She! Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me? Yes. The sea is all like, "Ted, come hang out. " I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off. Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are. Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal. No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed. You're going down. Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem? So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world? Wieners. That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily. Wieners and gonads. What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now? Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like Boogers. We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell "women" with a "Y" anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer. So how long have you felt this way? Honestly? Since my first day at GNB. Hershey squirts. Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed. Stuffed. Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening? Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk. Good luck killing James Bond. Are we allowed in here? What do you want from me? I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone. My life isn't perfect. Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy. It did. You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie. Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words. What? So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right? Affirmatootly. And become an environmental lawyer? Yepskerdoodles. Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf? Posititochadochmecochepopocha. Lawyered. Okay, that's also a made-up word. Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with. Niled it! Excuse me. Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits. I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain. He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants. I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building. It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads. Ted, that was really easy. What? They're a bunch of wieners and gonads. This should be useful. And in that moment, another headline appeared before my eyes. You tricked me. Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime. Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale? Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old. Oh, yeah, that story is legend Hold on. dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was? No. But I could, uh, check the files. Thank you. Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part from Guys and Dolls. Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche. So I hear my wife got you pretty good. She caught me on tape trashing GNB. Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. "But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend. " "I said no such thing. " "Oh, yeah?" Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings. Really? You'd do that to your own wife? Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of trouble, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem. No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that. Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking. Kids, there's an amazing architectural phenomenon in the Natural History Museum. If you stand in the right spot, you can hear an entire conversation all the way across the room. July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours, No. vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton No and flung said rib at giant whale. No. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. No. And the vandal's name No. Well, I'll be damned Barney Stinson. No! No! Who's the master, Leroy? Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker. Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle. Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything. Jerry's my uncle. Lily? Honey, what's wrong? You okay? Do you want a hit of this sandwich? I want you. Awesome. Let me just put a sock on the doorknob. No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much. What? How have I changed? Did I cheat on you? No. Did I stop writing poems for you? Yes, but I'm okay with that. Am I not as good at making the sweet, sweet love to you? Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long. You said that any longer would be too much. It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall Corporate Marshall he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back. Well, you can't have me. Look at the sign. I'm extinct. I've gone the way of Jane's Addiction. Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together. They did? Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album. Are you serious?! That is awesome! Are they just as good? Sure. Look, I know that Corporate Marshall wears a tie and everything, but it sounds like he hasn't changed where it counts. Hey. Hi. Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids? We'll make it work. There he goes. The Marathon Man. Mr. Stamina himself. I can kiss better than that old man. So when was the last time you saw him? It was that day July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark. Moms. He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away. Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad. Barney, do you want? I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay? I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses? Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I What are you doing? Oh, I thought we were Fine. I erased the tape. What? I don't need it. I'm going to beat you fair and square. Thanks. But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman. You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound. Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs. Bring it on, Princess. 00 a. m. You know what, you might as well not even go home. And so Marshall stayed right on at Goliath National Bank. Of course, it wouldn't last forever. But that's another story. And I wanted it to be unforgettable. Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey! A Turturkeykey? Mm-hmm. Uh-uh, oh-oh. Yeah, I was there for the "insertion. " He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides. Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early. What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up? Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz. Blitz was a guy we knew in college. Sadly, he was cursed. Well I'm calling it a little early. Wh you sure? We got big plans. Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz? Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with "Weird Al" Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now. We'll see what happens. mac and cheese and Tomb Raider. You see, every time Blitz left a place, something amazing happened. Oh! I'm sorry. I thought this was my room. Completely naked! Completely naked! Aw, man! And the movie was awesome. Aw, man! At the exact moment Brando first appeared, "Weird Al" launched right into "Eat It. And over the years, "The Curse of The Blitz" continued. Well, I'm gonna call it. I just got Madden 2K1, and I can't stop thinking about it. See you later! Bye-bye! All right, bye-bye! Okay, later! Good-bye! Bye-Bye!  Free beer for everyone! Free beer for everyone! Aw, man! You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become The Blitz. All right, first of all there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe "The Curse of The Blitz" is real. Kids, I'd live to regret those words. You see, the "Curse of Blitz" could be passed from one person to the next, at any moment. Blitz had gotten the curse from Jerry Windheim, back in freshman year, who got it years before that from Davey Beaterman. The original Blitz, Matt Blitz, was a guy who went to Wesleyan back in the '60s. He dropped out right before the school went co-ed. And then, Thanksgiving morning What the hell happened here? Hey! Morning, Blitz! Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz. My Blitzy lies over the ocean ♪ My Blitzy lies over the sea ♪ My Blitzy lies over the ocean ♪ So bring back my Blitzy Please stop. Okay, fine. ♪To me. The Gentleman! Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's "The Gentleman"? Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes. Kids, you remember Zoey. For the last two months, she'd been making my life hell. The Gentle  How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?! Sorry, Ted. We can explain. Oh, my God That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down. Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner! Finish the story, Red. Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around. And then I'm just going to leave her there buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed. Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme. Wait-- Ted doesn't like that girl? Okay. Wh? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it. Can I help you? Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?! Well, yeah. You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online. That was you?! Yeah. Oh! Thanks! Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her. The Gentleman!  And then, the craziest thing happened. I missed a skateboarding dog? Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part. It wasn't? Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare? Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare. Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger. Best idea ever! Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them. Ho, ho, ho, ho! Whoa! Yay! Yeah. Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers. Um. And send!  Wait. Blitz was there, too? The Gentleman! The Gentleman! Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said "Grand Theft Auto" can wait a night. It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary! I'm not The Blitz! I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory. The university president's toupee being snatched by a hawk at graduation, Zeppelin reuniting at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah, countless nip-slips, crotch shots, shooting stars and double rainbows. I've missed them all! Well, not anymore, Blitz. My name's not Blitz. My name is Steve! Colors seem so bright now. Thank you, Blitz. What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily! I tried. Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Renée Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon! Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree! That's Kate Hudson! Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson. No, we hate Zoey!  I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen?  Okay, I'm, uh, just gonna preheat the oven. The oven. Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven. Make out with Zoey! Make out with Zoey! Make out Did they tell you about the skateboarding dog? It was awesome! Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving? Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall. But if it helps, I reached 4G. It doesn't help. 4G? Mm-hmm. No. What-What are we supposed to do now? This is awesome! I'm part of this! Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard. Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas. Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny explosion at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now. This is awesome! It's not awesome! I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey. Um Um I'm have I'm having trouble breathing! Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger. Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option. Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway. Could we bring Ted? It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?  No. Absolutely not. Come on. Give her a chance. Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain. Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?  And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz! But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself? No. I c Because Step on it. You missed it. Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade! Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang "Twist and Shout!" But he's The Blitz. No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz. Blitz Oh, God, no! Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it. Chicka-chicka! Happy Thanksgiving! Ted. Zoey. Best friend alert! Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking. Oh, God, that is disgusting! Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt. No no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back. Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back. It's a boom-a-wang. Nice. Thank you. No, I meant the wang. Barney, could you get me some more ice? Sure. But no one move while I'm gone. I'm scared. You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen. Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this. Okay, I got to test this. What happened? You missed it! Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled. Aw, man! You said I could leave the room! I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side. No! Y-You Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you. Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold. Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity. Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you. Facial! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste. I'm coming with you. No I baste alone. Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted. Word play. Loving it. But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through. Who canceled? Your coven? Coven. Group of witches. Boom. Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair. Oh! Serve returned. Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either. God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling. Oh I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman. Ted, give her a chance. Enemies can't become friends. Yes, they can. Right, guys?  No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night. Well, let's get an outside opinion. Who are we gonna-- "Dear Wang Guy" Oh. "Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering. " Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy? He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you? What? No. Shut up. I hate him. Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. "Yes, enemies can become friends. "Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world. That is amazing. And I was here for it. Now Zoey is The Blitz. Ha, ha!  Burn on her. Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz. I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair! What does that have to do with anything? Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before! Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it. Whoa! Oh, my God! Did you do that on purpose? What? No. It was an accident. Oh, yeah. Well, like this is. Oh, great. Real mature. Yeah, well, you started it. Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee. Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother! Oh, get out. All of you, out! But it's Thanksgiving. And I'm a part of it. Out! Wait Where's Barney? Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo Aw, man. I don't get it. And then the cab driver said the last thing any of us wanted to hear. Where to?  I guess we're going home. Yeah. I don't know where that is. Lily, where'd you get that? Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? "Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey. " I wonder who Hannah is. Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother! Get out! All of you, out! We have to go back to Zoey's. You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy. Oh, God. What are you doing here? Barney let us in. Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked. Aw, man! Wait. Which half? Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you. How do you know that? I just do. It must be tough. It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute, she changed her mind. She hates my guts. I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year. Yeah Right. Next year. Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever. And that's the story of how Zoey and I became friends. Cheers. Cheers. Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy. Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three. Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks. It didn't. It tasted wrong. Oops. We forgot to light the candles. Oh. Oh, yeah. And just as Barney looked away, it happened. The Gentleman! What happened? I saw it! Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket. Blitz. Zoey was married to The Captain. Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay? Okay. That man is terrifying. Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared. Keep smiling. He can still see us. There was just something about him. We couldn't put our finger on it until I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain. Okay. Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey. Observe. The bottom half of his face is smiling. Oh. Look, he seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. wants to murder you! Cheerful. Wants to murder you. No. Cheerful. Wants to murder you. Now, hold on. Let me ask him a question. Captain, what do you think of ice cream? Oh, he loves it! Captain, what do you think of rainy days?  Whoa, he hates them. How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. What-What is that? I don't get it. I don't get it. He hates that he loves them. Ah! Captioning sponsored by 20th CENTURY FOX TELEVISION, CBS and TOYOTA. Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in? Sorry, I'm, uh, I I- I don't know, washing my hair. Running the water. Holding the towel. And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited me to the big hair washing party. All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey. Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude. don't go anywhere that has candles. Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? Mm-hmm  It'll be the last dinner they ever have. No sharing food. Hmm. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick. Well, if I can't share her lipstick, there's really no point in even going. And the most important rule of all Lubricant is public property. Please. No lying to the spouse about anything you do. Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her. Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite sex. Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness? No doubt, Robo Cop. You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now. I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone. Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us. Oh! Sweet. No candles. No candles. Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. And then Lily said something to Barney that insulted every fiber of his being. Nah. Wait. No. It had to be more than just, "Nah. No, that doesn't make sense. Okay, hang on. What did she say? She said, um, uh To be honest kids, I'm having a little trouble remembering exactly what their fight was about. Hey, it was 20 years ago! I'll remember. Anyway, the next night Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night. Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends. Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me. Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do? Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends? Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay? It's totally okay. It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey? No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem. Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat. Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved. The next night, Marshall and Robin went to dinner, just the two of them. cold weather December chill-- so great. Totally. sports Did you catch the game last night? Yeah. Nail-biter. and cold weather sports. You know what's fun? Mm. Is cold weather sports. They are fun. They blew through them all in the first 16 seconds. Man, this is awkward. She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching. Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it. Can I get you two some drinks? Lots of drinks. Oh, so many drinks. That same night, Barney and Lily were still fighting about, um something. Or was it that other thing? Barney. Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for something, and for that other thing. Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately. Wait. They were on the street. Watch out! Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad. I think I probably didn't. And just like that, the fight was over. You know, kids, friendship is funny sometimes. Wait. I still can't resist getting one last shot in. Like I said, the fight was just getting started. Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain. Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you. Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey? Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters. Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some witnesses. You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Kids, here's one thing I do remember. I was pretty sure I was going to die that night. Mmm. Mmm. You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college. What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that right up. Robin, I'm an attorney. Fine. This night's a little awkward. I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together. Why is that? It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory. Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB. So, who's the eye broccoli? Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good. Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs. I don't think that's gonna be a problem. Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be? I'm sorry. Myth? It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock-- the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now. And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually  D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks. Did we bet on this? Let's say yes. And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes. As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid. Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now? Big-time manatee. What were those sailors thinking? Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man. Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this. Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing. He's gonna kill me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey. So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey. Okay, back to Barney and Lily and whatever the hell they were fighting about. Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there. What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face! Wait. Barney's not a woman. That's right-- Barney wasn't hurt by Lily, Lily was hurt by Barney. Want to hang? Nah. Wow thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face! Okay, now I'm on track. The rest of this story should make perfect sense. Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?  You're a jerk. Okay, that makes no sense. Kids, I'm officially admitting defeat. I will never remember this story. I'm sorry for wasting your time. Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection. Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates? How now? Oh, bother. Well she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head. Head? No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea. Well, I got a big morning, so Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here. Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a "Good Effort" ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes. Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight. And just as I started to realize that maybe I wasn't in danger after all, we hit a bump. Whoa!  Ted? that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid? Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber Am I blushing or? but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' "Part of Your World" to my pants. Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me? I asked Barney the same thing. Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome. Death? Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty. Pregnancy? Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence. Wait! That's it! That's what Barney and Lily were fighting about! The Mermaid Theory! But their argument didn't happen at the same time as all this other stuff. I'm literally in the wrong year! It happened much, much later when Lily was pregnant. Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang? Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes. High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee. Well, you're a big stupid octopus face! That was it! I remember now! Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman "fat" right to her face! I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick? Oh You're a jerk. Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act. What's that? Breast-feeding. Hot. Really? Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size so do I. That's so sweet! See kids? Told you I'd get it! Okay, now we're even! Yeah, that's the ending to a whole other story. We'll get there. So you really thought I was gonna kill you? Well ish. Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to kill you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net. See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way? Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies. We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat. Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is. You know, once we stopped trying to have a conversation and just focused on the drinking I had fun. Yeah, me, too. And then a terrible thing happened. Marshall's beer goggles kicked in and his very drunk mind started to see No No, no! No! No, don't turn! Uh-oh. I don't feel so good. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting. I really do. And from that moment on Marshall never worried about Robin becoming a mermaid again, and the two of them were closer than ever. There you go. Hey, Ted. Hey. You feeling better? I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick. You weren't? I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together. I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary. Yeah, he gets a little murder-y when he's nervous. Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines. Me, too. I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you? No. Do you? No. Still no sign of land. It's been 243 days since we've seen another living soul. What are you looking at? Dude, we need to find land. It seemed like something we all needed. After all, it had been a crazy couple of days. It all started With a pregnancy test. This is taking forever. Are you sure you did it right? Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick? Hey, can I ask you a question that's plagued me for years? Can girls aim? Um, can boys aim? 'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop to that bathroom floor every two days. Okay, you're the one who put the Far Side calendar up over the toilet. You know I laugh with my whole body. It's been two minutes. One, two, three. It's positive. It's positive? It's positive? It's positive. It's positive? It's positive! It's positive! Whoa!  Whoa! I'm pregnant. What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations! To Lily and Marshall. To Lily and Marshall. Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Mm. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now. You're not pregnant. Well, that did it. Kids, this is the story of the 36 hours we all thought Lily was pregnant, and how it caused each of us to reexamine our own lives. Because while this was happening Are you sure you did it right? I was on the phone with Punchy, my best friend from high school, who had recently asked me to be his best man. Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements. Ah, here it comes. Hit me up, Schmos! Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation. Crushed it! That's exactly the accent of whimsy this celebration of love needs! It's gonna be a magical day. I know what you're thinking. I wish I was a dude. I do wish you were a dude. Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man. No, and here's why. Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his rifle and charge up the hill. Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man. And how did that go again?  Oh for one. Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast. Ted. Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man? Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of Million Dollar Heads or Tails. Kids, Million Dollar Heads or Tails was an extremely popular show with an extremely simple premise. All right, your practice flip came up tails But our Vegas oddsmaker tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50. And so, Jordan, for one million dollars Heads or tails?  What was the year of the coin again? Why this sudden obsession with Heads or Tails? Well, it turns out that Heads or Tails has a job opening. Ta heads. Marni, flip that coin. Ooh! Damn!  So now, because of that incident, Heads or Tails is looking for a new currency rotation specialist. You mean coin flip bimbo? They're not bimbos! You auditioned, didn't you? And you're Canadian?! Mm. Robin, aside from that coin, this is the other thing that's flipping right now. What is my lid? For you. You're the new coin flip bimbo? Currency rotation specialist. Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you? Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses! Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution? I am never drinking again. No, before that. I am gonna finish this whole bottle tonight. Before that, too. I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I. D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth. I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News. Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job. Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career. Well, so could Heads or Tails. The first currency rotation specialist went on to be a semi-finalist on The Bachelor, and then, she lost, like, a hundred pounds on The Biggest Loser, and now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab. It seemed like there was no changing Robin's mind. But what we didn't know, in that moment, was that our world was about to be turned upside down. I'm pregnant. What?! Now, kids, when your friends have great news, you're happy for them For, like, a millisecond. And then you start thinking about yourself. Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job. And so, the next night, we had two things to celebrate. Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News. Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news. What changed your mind? Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. Who gives her beer. What? What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall. To Lily and Marshall. Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. So the next day Robin called Heads or Tails to respectfully decline. Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky. But at that moment You're not pregnant. Oh, my God. They're not having a baby. What am I getting all up in my head about? That research job sounds hard. And I'm pretty. I'm really, really pretty. You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo. You took the heads or tails job? Yeah. What about World Wide News, your I. D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution. Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house? We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack. Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy. Where was Barney? Let's back up again. You see, while this was going on It's positive. It's positive?! This was happening. And now she's totally winning Celebrity Rehab. Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n? Bon Jovi? Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n?  Bonus. As in, my end-of-the-year bonus check. My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee. And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The DiBiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit. Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity? Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang. Hey, guys. Hi. Hey. Big announcement. Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too. No, just a $30 gift card to Costa Coffee. Thirty?! I'm pregnant. What?! What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations! Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life? We've never been happier. I can't imagine bringing me down right now. Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. is Barney's Favorite Things!  That was the reaction Barney expected. This was the one he got. Huh? I don't know what that is. Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff like Oprah. Just get excited, okay? The next hour got pretty weird. Velour track suits! Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft. Remote control helicopters!  You get a lap dance! You get a lap dance! You're gonna give me a lap dance! Everybody gets a lap dance! That was amazing! It was like a diamond suit for my soul. I gotta keep going. I gotta do more. No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things. I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club. The next day, he paid a visit to the most charitable man he knew, his half-brother's father, Sam Gibbs, a minister at a church out on Long Island. Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless What's up, Barney? I'm thinking about giving some money to charity. Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney. No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail. What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe. I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more. Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews. Well, I would love to help by writing a check for one, zero, zero, zero You're not pregnant. Woops. Hold on a second. Wait. They're not doing something meaningful with their lives. Well, this changes everything. Oh, no, I've already written four zeroes. Thank you, decimal point. One hundred dollars. That's great! Thank you, Barney! Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me. What happened to giving the money away? Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born. Dude, what's up with the gingerbread house? You look ridiculous! It's a Christmas-themed movie snack! Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree O holy night. Nice. Let's back up one last time. I'm pregnant. What?! What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations! This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now. I can. And I'm freaking out, too! There's an alien growing in my stomach that's gonna explode out of my vagina! Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out? What am I doing with my life? What am I doing with my life? I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night. They're totally onto us. What do we do? Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense! I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell. Let's leave, then the waving will make sense. So Marshall and Lily headed home. Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight! Let's do it!  Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy. 00! We're supposed to meet the gang at the bar to celebrate. Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall. Lily and Marshall. Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. The Jerky Boys! Our baby heard the Jerky Boys! You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny. The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful. You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips. Marshall, I don't like this. I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away! You're not pregnant. Well, that did it. I know this probably comes as quite a disappointment. Yeah. Huge bummer. So disappointing. Hey. Hey. Are you guys okay? Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing. Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice. Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated. Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there. Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all. Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog. Get a puppy! Can you imagine That would be the cutest thing!  No! Oh. Our movie snack. Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Marshall and Lily got in trouble. And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list. I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark! Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!  So, if I get a large popcorn, you want to go split-skees or And you You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo.

We're ready for this. We're ready for this. Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point? Nope. And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon, you'll meet everyone there, but first you need to head down to security. You need to get your picture taken. For your I. D. badge. Oh. You sure? Positive. And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews? Yeah. Why? Bring 'em in, boys!  Merry Christmas. Thank you, son. Son?! It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad. Congratulations. You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path. It's what I do. Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying Big mistake, but go on. I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested? Are you asking what I think you're asking? Ted, will you be my best man? Scherbatsky I'm gonna crush it. Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's One to grow on. Um, no. Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children. And how long have you been trying? Six days. Oy. But then, months went by, and still nothing happened. Something must be wrong. W we're doing it a lot. And everywhere the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait the kitchen. Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening? Look, if you're really worried, here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist Dr. Stangel. He's the best in the city. Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist? Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected sex day after day after day in every position imaginable until? Wait, it sounded worse in my head. Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments. Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt. So Aunt Lily went to see Dr. John Stangel, the man who knew more about human reproduction than anyone in New York City. So I understand you want to get pregnant. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel. dietary, environmental, genetic. But first, Ms. Aldrin, do you have any questions for me? Just one, "Dr. Stangel". Where'd you get the beard? Well, m my mother's Armenian. 00 a. m. Between the sexual harassment seminar all morning and the secretary beauty pageant all afternoon, he hasn't left my sight. Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day? Not today I wasn't. Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney. Uh, Marshall? Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out. you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up; I'll meet you in stall three. I still kind of think it's Barney. There's no way it's Barney. Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen. I am Dr. Stangel. It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get? - Would you? - I So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant. All right, Ms. Aldrin, please just put your feet up in the stirrups. We can begin. Uh-uh, no. He checks out. Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the vagina. Okay. Convinced. Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up. "Suit up" not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven. Baby, you just saw Barney. He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit? Oh, yeah Bjorney. Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him. How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?! Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results. Thank you. Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?! Can we leave him in here for a while? I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night. Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite! Now, while all this was going on, your Aunt Robin was starting her new job at World Wide News, aka the big leagues. She was excited. This job was a new start, a clean slate. So, first day of work? Everyone, say hello to your new research associate Robin Scherbatsky. Oh, here comes our new Hardfire host. Robin, this is Sandy Rivers. Sandy Rivers?! Sandy Rivers Robin's old co-host and my old nemesis. We should have sex. Oh, I hate that guy. It gets worse. Sandy, this is Robin. You had sex with Sandy Rivers? No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show. Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host? Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not. Hey, babe. Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes. Yeah, uh, we got a game of "Go Fish" going on the phone. P. S. , Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from? Dr. Stangel's office. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. puts the ball on the 44-yard-line. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem. Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem. Well, I was just putting on a brave face. we've had unprotected sex past four months. Obviously I'm the problem. Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children. So, second day of work? What's wrong? Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut. Already? Oh, honey. I wish I was the office slut. And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq. Yes. We definitely had sex. We did not have sex. Then why do I remember you? I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional. No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have sex. Thank you. You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop We did have sex. Oh, I I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor. But this reporter takes pride in whoa! And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, - you steer into the skid. Exactly! Or when your I don't know friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney guns a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted. Oh, it's my dad. Aren't you going to get it? No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up. I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me. I'm getting married! Yeah! I passed the bar! All right! I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord. I'll show you. "Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion". Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome". So, third day of work? And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius. Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments. A few? Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh Just the one. Gregory. Oh, God. What did they find? Everything. Everybody, come and play ♪ I'm a dirty, dirty girl. Throw every last care away ♪ Let's go to the mall today ♪ Today, today ♪ The Federal Reserve Board voted to leave interest Let's go to the mall ♪ Today ♪ Let's go to the ma-a-all ♪ Aah.

You got attacked by an owl? I did not get attacked by an owl. Robin, listen, here's what you need to do Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job. Kids, at that moment, I knew what I had to do for my friend Robin. But first I had to do something for me. Show me "owl attack". I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot. Well, we won't know anything until we run some tests. We'll need a sample of your sperm. No, no, no. There's a room at the end of the hall. If you find yourself inside the elevator, you've gone too far. You'd think I wouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised. All yours, buddy. The thing you're about to do in here I did that in here, too. Three minutes ago. I was here eight minutes ago. I'm here every Thursday. I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I Could I take this home? Sure, you could, but, uh we close in an hour and I'm not back till Tuesday. So, clock is ticking. Make it fast. Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how. Dad. Uh What are you doing here? We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you. For God's sake, son. Do you have any sixes? Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute? - Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height. Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else. Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well Wait, wait, wait. Marshall. Thank you, baby. You're the best. Marshall. Marshall. I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer. It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine? Me in a two-piece bathing suit at my age? Just picture it! Picture it! That's why Fred Cox is the greatest kicker the Vikings ever had. Seriously, Marshall, picture it. Just picture it. Give me a "C". Give me an "O". Give me an "X". What's that spell? Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Uh Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address. Who? Sorry. You said "who". It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think Sorry. "Who". Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list. Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there. I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse. Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists. They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment. Ah You're not the pizza guy. Oh, my God. This is This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down. If people found out Sandy wears a toupee Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra? Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy. And the top is so low-cut. Your father says he has front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins. Oh. Oh. By the way, Marshall, we do need to know if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming? Marshall? Marshall, are you coming? This isn't working. Where you going, son? I'm I'm going to I'm I'm going to Kids, to this day, your uncle Marshall is thankful for what Lily said next. He's going to masturbate. Lily! Marshall, just tell them what's going on. And so Marshall told his parents everything. And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild. Aw, Marshall. Hey, we don't care about that one bit. And if you guys want kids, there are other ways. Adoption. Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm? Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption. What I'm saying is, we love you no matter what. Now, why don't you pretend you're in high school, get back in that bathroom, and "blow dry your hair". Wait, you knew? We didn't have a hair dryer, dear. So? Possibly last day of work? Actually, it was a good day. And I need more numbers on how the holiday season impacted the economy. Sparkles, got anything on malls? Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see. Yes! Put him in a body bag! Hoo! Hoo! Hyah! - Okay, I didn't do it. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice. That day, Robin decided to steer into the skid. And though she never quite shook the nickname, Sparkles went on to do very well at World Wide News. Especially after this happened. After his parents had gone back to Minnesota, Marshall got the results of his test. I'm afraid I have some very bad news, Marshall. Judging from the results of your test, it is it is very unlikely that you'll be able to father a child. Oh, God. I know, I know. It's just Now in some rare cases, a regimen change can fix the problem, so I'm recommending a spirited cardio routine. Preferably with a partner, involving any light-based firearm activity in the Tri-State area. Poughkeepsie, for example. Have you heard of the gentlemen's sport known as laser tag? Surprise! Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here? Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20% off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation? Go! Well, Marshall. I've got your results. And? Your sperm is fine. My sperm is fine! Count, motility everything's off the charts. You, sir, have got some strong swimmers. Bro, that is awesome. Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? - I want to call my dad. Man, this is great. I was expecting bad news. I really was. You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it? Marshall Something's happened. Um Your father, he had a heart attack. He he didn't make it. My dad's dead? I'm not ready for this. only to find yourself standing there with no idea what to do or say. This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help? Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, "I have to pee. " And I, "Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you. I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here. Whoa! Cigarettes, alcohol Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse. Be cool, nerds! Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Sweet save. Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty. "Judy duty. " She said "doody. " Really, guys? At a funeral? Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s- After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy. Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh. How? Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up? Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts. Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops. What about animals? Uh Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this! Hey, guys, sorry, uh I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have? Outlet or USB? Uh, outlet. Thank you. Oh Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you? You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs. "If"? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. "Spoonful of sugar"? Grow up. I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy. Thank you, Reverend. Unfortunately, I can't. My daughter in Chicago just went into labor. my son. Your son? Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him. Guys Trey Platt terrorized me growing up. He was, he was the toughest bully in school. 'Sup Marshall. Hello, Trey. Long time. Mm-hmm. I was not aware that you had become a reverend. Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding! Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh. Yeah! This video is entitled, "Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can. " I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch. The fat kid just runs away. Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey "The Noogie Machine" Platt. That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder? He made me carry it. So, my dad has these questions he asks to help create a theme for the service, or whatever. "What were your last words with the deceased?" Lame. Wait My last words with Marvin were lovely. I've been thinking about them a lot. Me, too. We went for a hike in the snow and had this amazing talk. My last day with Pop, he taught my son how to skate. Well, this is clearly yielding nothing. Thanks, Dad. Guess I'll have to fill the time with some jokes again. "Last words" seems like a good theme. Marshall, do you remember the last thing your father said to you? Bye, sweetie. Bye, Mom. Son, there's something I want to say before I leave. Yeah, Dad? Could I snag that extra pork chop for the flight? I was gonna make a sandwich with that, Dad. Ah Dad, don't they have food on the plane? Yeah, but plane food is ass. "Plane food is ass. " Those are the last words my father will ever say to me. Right after I denied the man a pork chop. Oh, God. Wait! I'm wrong! I'm wrong! That wasn't it! They couldn't find a cab Hey, Marshall! so my dad called up from the street. Marshall! Looks like rain out here! I couldn't find an umbrella in your closet! You know who probably has an umbrella? And then, well, see, my dad grew up in a small town, in another generation, so sometimes-- totally well-meaningly-- he'd say stuff like The Koreans across the hall! Hey, the Koreans are a trustworthy and generous people! Dad I betcha one of the Koreans has an umbrella! Heck, they're Koreans! My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes. All that stuff was really nice! Yeah! It's positive racism! This is worse than the pork chop. This next clip is entitled, "Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull"" Let's see what happens. Here he comes  'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts. And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks. Fall off. Shorts just fall right off. No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there. Hey, you were right. The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella. Of course they did. Bye, sweetie. Bye, Mom. Hey, son, I just want to leave you with a little advice. Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night. It totally holds up! Crocodile Dundee III is the second-best of the Croc trilogy, so maybe I can live with that. Oh, sorry, my phone's charged. I, uh, I hear you're a woman who can get things. I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time. I need vodka and dirty playing cards. I got ya. Oh, my God. What is it? I have a voice mail from my dad. You have a voice mail from your dad? How? My phone's been out of juice, so he must've called me the day the he, uh Baby, are you okay? I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play. What's wrong? What if it's worse than Crocodile Dundee III? I can't do this. I can't My mom is about to collapse. I'm gonna Wait-- no, no, baby Baby, I got it. Let me. You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it. She's right. Exactly. All those "famous last word"" people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history? My I only regret is I have but one life to lose for my country. You know what his real last words were? I'm peeing my pants! True story. The point is, last words are overrated. you get to hear your dad's voice one last time. I should go listen to this alone, okay? I'll be back. Okay. Hey, so, um, I heard you might have You heard right. I'm getting a reputation. So, what you need, mama? Come here. Guys, listen to what just happened. Judy, do you need a break? I'm happy to cook for a while. You think your snobby New York cooking is better than mine-- admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't you just whip up a batch of your fancy tofu sushi bagels! And choke on them! Whoa. Are you okay? Listen!  I'm gonna go take a nap. I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah! Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that? Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now. Hey, stay hydrated. Hey. So? I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard. We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said. It doesn't. That's true. Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously. I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his post-divorce bachelor pad. Been fun bro-ing out with you tonight, T-Dawg. Yeah so glad we can we can talk about our sex lives now. That's totally an improvement. I hooked up with a younger woman the other week-- Donna Bromstead. My prom date?! How far did you get, T-Dawg? I have to go. Ugh How would you like those to be your father's last words? Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop. Lawyered. Lily?  Hello. Lily, it's Dad. Listen, I'm sort of in jail for not paying taxes for the last 25 years. But bright side-- I thought of a great new board game. "Tax Evasion"-- ages six to ten. Which is, ironically, what I might be looking at. Anyway, Pumpkin, I need $15,000. Fooled ya. Leave a message after the beep. We'll get back to ya. Beep. Lawyered. Robin? And so, despite the endless disappointment you've caused me, I pray that this will finally be the year you achieve something of actual significance. I'd love to stop lying to my friends about you being in a coma. Anyway, the point is, happy birthday, RJ. Whoa-ho! Wow. That's awful. No, here's the awful part. You remembered my birthday! Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal? Yes. Yes. Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called "German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink. " Barney, please, Barney! It's No more videos, okay? I just need a minute. Okay okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old. Whoa, they grow big out here. And here's your phone number back. Judy, I I did it. What possible excuse could you have for this? I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny. There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm! That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts. Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once. Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid. Stupid. What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts. Yes. Nothing beats the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit? Hey, Marshall. So that's it? No discussion? I'm not going to listen. "Rent Crocodile Dundee II"" are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that. Is he laughing? Marshall really did think he could live with that. That is, until later, at the memorial service. My last talk with Marvin was so lovely. The stories his mother and brothers told were so perfect. Then he picked my crying son up off the ice. He gave him a hug and said, "Champ, it doesn't matter if you fall down once in a while. " And as we hiked, a little deer appeared on the path. She hopped over to Dad and started eating-- right out of his hand. And then he kissed me and he said "I will always be proud of you"" "Life is such a gift. " "You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive. Lame. These stories suck. Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing. You're up next, baby. I just need some air. Baby, are you okay? I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing. Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one? She's right. Your dad was hilarious. You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with?  Thanks a lot, God! Thank you! You took my father-- the greatest man that I have ever known-- and you ripped him off this Earth, way too young! And he'll never get to meet our kids, Lily. But we got this voice mail. Thank you so much for the voice mail! It's a great comfort! 'Cause whenever I'm starting to feel lonely or sad, or-- or you know what, or maybe a little bit cheated, at least I got the sound of his pocket to console me. Marshall How is this fair? You know, like, an entire human life and it just ends for no reason, and and what are we left with?  Marshall? Oh, looks like I've been calling you for almost five minutes. How's my pocket sound?  Oh, sorry about that, buddy. Um, anyway, your mom and I had such a great time seeing you. I love you. Looks like your dad came through one last time. "I love you. " My father's last words to me are "I love you. " Ooh, and let me know if you find my foot cream. That fungus thing is acting up again. "I love you. " My father's last words to me are "I love you. " Yes. Yes, they were. We heard it. Loud and clear. Bye, Pop. So Marshall finally got up to speak. "Rent Crocodile Dundee III. "I caught it on the cable last night and it totally holds up. " He decided to keep Marvin's real last words just for himself. Thanks. For what? I know what you've been doing today. And I really needed it. Any time. That dress makes you look like a Kansas City whore. Sorry, dear. Last one. Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III. Okay, seriously, how are you doing that? Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce. Last words-- it's a lot of pressure, kids. And what do we know ♪ It gets you thinking. About what we've earned ♪ Will all the love we've spent Hi, Dad. Return to us ♪ Hi, Dad. Or will we sour one another ♪ Hi, Dad. In a rush ♪ Hey, Mom. To feel right. ♪ I'm ready to meet my dad. But the longer he stayed there, the more it was like he had never left Minnesota. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking. Oh, that is too cute. Say it again. No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something. There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted and Zoey. to save an old building from being torn down and replaced by a new building that I'd been hired to design. And yet somehow, despite this, we had all managed to become friends. Which brings us to the night Aunt Robin decided to cook dinner. I thought the oven was Celsius. It's okay. We got hot dogs. Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom. Could someone pass the ketchup? I hope I can pass this hot dog. Oh. Oops. Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup. Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine. Which is all gone. Oops. All right, I tell you what-- you get this one bottle, I'll get the next three. Hmm, tell you what-- no dice. I'll get the next hundred. You're not getting out of this. You want to go on a date with my hot cousin? I'll get the ketchup. Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good. Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while. Finally, Ted called her up. Hello. So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin. You still want to do that? Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going. Don't worry, Ted, she's cute. "Cute" means "fat"" She's not fat. "Not fat" means "ugly"" Oh, here she is. I take back everything I said. That girl is extremely attractive. Hey, Zoey. Hey. Kids, to be honest, I don't quite remember this girl's name. None of us do, because as this story has been told and retold, we've always just referred to her as Honey. Hi, Honey, I'm Ted. And here's why. She is a lovely person-- warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, "Oh, honey. " Interesting. Show your work. My apartment building is so safe. My landlord-- he even installed a security camera in my shower. Oh, honey. Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince. Oh, honey. I just had a great TV audition. Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends. Oh, honey. Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost. Oh, honey. I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself. Oh, honey. So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey. Wow, an architect. How fascinating. Why do they call 'em coasters? And Barney. Okay, time to go home. Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this? What are you talking about? Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me. What? It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close? Mm-hmm. Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean that's as clear as a signal gets, so I'm so sorry, man. You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has. Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys. Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her. Hmm? He's gay! Mom, hang up! I'm sorry. Go on. Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her. Hmm? I'm in love with Zoey. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Mom! Sorry. Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention. Funny you should say that. Yeah, who called this intervention? I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath. Finally. Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair. Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch. It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And intervene. Are you sure it's love?  Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and  I knew, right in that moment, this isn't friendship. This is love. Wuss. Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next? This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. I have to end my friendship with Zoey. Isn't that a little harsh? Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other. Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around. Then what am I supposed to do? Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours-- shut 'em down. Fine. I'll shut 'em down. And seriously, mouthwash after coffee. Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize. So don't answer it. Yeah. Oh, my God, you are so Minnesota. You can't not answer the phone because it would be rude. Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking. Hey, Marshall. Barney. W- What number is this? I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone. Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing. Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story. Hey, Zoey. Hey. Ted, this is my cousin Honey. Uh Robin's version was That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her. Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Wow, an architect. How fascinating. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Straw. Coaster. Okay, time to go home. Anyway, I get Honey back to her place. Who's your daddy? Okay, can we skip this part, please? Sure, I'll just summarize it. Okay, that's been going on a while. Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey. Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours-- Honey-- yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts. Thanks. Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so Wait, she didn't go home with Ted? Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize  She hugged me. What was that all about? Zoey's in love with Ted. Marcus! Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring. Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted. Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut? Sure. Hey, where's the? No! Aah! Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro. So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted. Hello. Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey. Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too. Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me. Can I get you a beer? Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way. Oh, my God. What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you?  What? Listen, Zoey, I, um I need to tell you something. Um Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything? Mom! Get off the phone! Could you get some more Bugles, please? Of course, dear. Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on. I, uh I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but you can't ask me why. Wow. Okay. And that was it. No more Zoey. Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby. We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops. Ted's a son of a bitch!  Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey. Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story? I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why. Why? Lily hates you. You hate me? That's crazy. I don't hate you. Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything. He Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly? Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends. Oh, he Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch. I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff. Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff? I don't know. Well, you did the right thing, baby. Not entirely. Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because Robin hates you. And that's Robin on the other line. Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby! Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking. Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her. Me? You dragged me into this?! You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and  Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey! Just don't answer it. I can't not answer. It's impolite. Marshall, you can beat this. I can't turn my back on politeness. You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring. Good manners are what separate us from those "elbows on the table" Wisconsinites. You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall! I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking. Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh I was his first. Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin. Hi. Listen, um, about Barney Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy. I don't know. I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address. So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me. Oh, honey. I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me. Oh, honey. I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son. Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees. Four. Four Nobel Prizes. Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have? Only three. Well, there you go. Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through? Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist. I am her therapist. Oh! Well, in that case Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!  What's this really about? I told you. Lily hates you. I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it. All right. Yes. I hate you. Great. See? Was that so hard? Zoey. Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought  I just want to know why. So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what? Zoey's in love with Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey-- they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going. Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well I guess I'll take it. Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means? So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will. Give me that phone. Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph?  Go on, get it. I'll have more in a second. Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall. Yes, I am. Yes, I am. He is? Bye. Why was Marshall calling? Don't worry about it. Go on. You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese. Well, actually  You're a show-off. You better take that. Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go. They're kissing. They're kissing?! Yeah!  They're kissing! They're kissing, Mom! They're kissing! Look, um I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own. Someone knows how to set a mood. I just mean I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right. My friends, as usual, were completely supportive. You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great. Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies. Oh. booty-call. Total booty-call. Private Booty, reporting for duty. That's crazy. She-She wants to bake. 00 a. m. with a drunkenly slurred, "What ya doing?" But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good. It's called class, Ted. Wait. That You think that's what she means by "baking cookies"? Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, "Stop, Marshall, stop," but that's just code for "harder!" Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh? So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together. I should explain. On their very first Valentine's Day, Marshall and Lily set out to watch Sleepless in Seattle. You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl. Aw I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you. If it bleeds, we can kill it. Except Marshall's brothers had taped over it with Predator. Mmm. And it became a tradition. Wow, you sound really lonely. I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. Desperation Day. That's not a thing. It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death. That's actually true. Wait, there's more. This won't be. And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids. Whoa. Check out that one. Her body is a perfect X. Player, play on. High V. Oh, Jupiter, what are your plans for me? And I thought Pompeii was smokin'. Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax-- what up-- on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do. Please say "widows. 59 p. m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day. Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work Trolls. who could care less about Valentine's Day. Lying trolls. And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted. And none was taken until just then. I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself. See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before. I call him "Marshpillow. " And he calls me nothing because he's a pillow. Hey. Hey. That was a tough question. You see Hi. Uh Is that an overnight bag?  You brought an overnight bag? You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night. We said you were going to have sex. We didn't say, "Bring a carry-on. " So how did Zoey react? She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff. Were there slippers for the morning? Not slippers, exactly. They're called British morning socks. This is such a nice surprise. Marshall will be so happy. Oh How are you holding up, Judy? Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but  I'm not a lunatic. Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. Lily. What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries? Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes. Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom. Aw Anything for my baby bear. Get him out of my house. Take Marshall back to New York with you. Please, I am begging you. I thought he was here helping you. Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but  Uh, I'll talk to him. I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself. Oh, God. There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?  Hi. Hi. Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to "bake cookies. " We both knew what that meant. We totally did. I just, you know I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And ever since, I've been asking myself, "Am I ready for this?" And the answer is "yes. " They're actually called British morning socks. Yeah. Don't get in your own way. Right. Okay. Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you. My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Oops. Comin' right up! Ow. Ow. She needs this. Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?  Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car. Marshall, your mom wants you out of here. What? Anything else, sweetie? Mom, d-do you want me to leave? Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not! But, Judy, you said Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota. So Valentine's Day is tomorrow. Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing. I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you. Tomorrow night, my place. I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years. Isn't that great? Yeah, if you say so, yeah. What do you mean?  Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise. Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day. See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure. Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Kids, I'm not super proud of what I did next. Hi! I'm here to help Marshall. Meanwhile, as Desperation Day turned into Desperation Night God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted. Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex. Enchanté. That's French for "What's with the purple?" Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care. I use, uh, colors to express emotion. Purple is for pride. It was a stupid idea. Bev, you look at me. It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens. And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday. Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your "fiancé" who no one's ever met. Gerard is real! Oh!  Ted I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York. Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day? Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. No! Okay, when your "fiancé" Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you. Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late. Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna beat him in an arm wrestle? My elbow slipped! Marshall, I'm going home. What? I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me. I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me. While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day You have Super Mario Kart?! Hell, yeah. But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad. Baby, don't go. Please come home soon. So, you were an Olympic gymnast? Silver medal. Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts. That's what my dad said. And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll be right back. Hey, hey, sorry. Oh, hi. Quick question. Yeah. Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends? Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret? Sure. I love Valentine's Day. Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod? Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too? Guilty. This is embarrassing, but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know? We are pitiful. The worst. Although there is one difference between you and me. What's that? I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants. I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much. I know. Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights, but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything. All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13-- a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate. What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity? Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie. I have no idea what any of those words mean. Hey, I'm all stretched out! Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag. Thanks a lot for coming out here, man. Yeah. Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day? Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet. What? Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back. You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's We got to go back to New York, tonight. We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight. So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah. Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road? Crusts cut off. Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter. became the 2010 Tri-County Champions. Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant! Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza! This is my teammate for tomorrow. Oh, yeah, I agreed to that. Where are Bev and Anna? Well So, we're taking off. What? Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya. What? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple? But tomorrow's Valentine's Day. I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day. Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair. I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news. Well, I think I'm heading out, too. What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?! It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye. Mm. Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day What are you talking about? Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora. No, I don't. She's gross. Oh You like her. You think she smells like rain. Whatever you say. Oh, hey, Nora. Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out!  Gotcha. And so we drove through the night, out of Desperation Day and into Valentine's. And there was no trace of my little freak out, except Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set. Well, that was kind of presumptuous. ♪ ♪ The ground was shaking like ♪  Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying! Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day. Hap? Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here. And that's how, for the first time in his life, Barney Stinson wound up on a date on Valentine's Day. You will be avenged. Come on! Come on! Kill me! I'm here! Kill me! It's good to see you though ♪ Baby, you're back. Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh. We both knew this would end eventually. Like, remember that trip I took to Hong Kong where I got stuck in the airport? Well, a funny thing happened that day. Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport? Hey, Ted. Hey There she is. Wow. Wendy the Waitress. Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here? What was she doing there? For that, we have to back up about ten years. So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag. I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster. Not according to her. Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to. You want to grab a drink right now? No, I'm kind of tired. But this is my number. Give me a call. Absolutely. How is that a disaster? She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well You want to grab a drink right now? No, I'm kind of tired. Absolutely. It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids. Please, Cheese. You like this girl. What? Nora? No, I don't. Barney, you can't say her name without smiling. That's Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No ra. Nah Damn it, what is the matter with me? You like her. You should call her. Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase. That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice. Totally. Kids, I had just started dating Zoey. And when you first start dating someone, everyone wants to know the same thing. How did we meet? Oh, Ted, she doesn't want No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines. Oh, man, this movie is scary. I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my life, and the rest, as they say, is history. Actually, I said, "How's your meat?" Oh. A little cold. Gee, wonder why. Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment? Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me. You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman. If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow. All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a place. All right, see you guys later. I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately. Yeah, he's been really quiet. Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like-- strong, silent, you know, man's man. Like Prince. No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore. Oh. Ha-wink. Excuse me? Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since-- How do I not put this delicately?-- a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher. It's been a while. Five weeks, three days by my estimation. You should work at a carnival. I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds. Anyway, we should get going. Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys. Good night. Good night, guys. Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. Hmm. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one. Throw me one? Yeah. We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way. Oh, I see what's going on. Yeah? This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your shot. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care. Robin, you could not be more-- What do you mean I missed my shot? Nora met a guy. What?! What? Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night. But "L'Amour" means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it! Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed? I can't sleep. Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that? Maybe after this documentary on garbage. Man, I am losing my touch. Nearly twice the size of Texas, the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch, or "Garbage Island," is an enviwonmental disaster. Sepawated from its pawents, this young bird stwuggles to survive, stwangling itself in the plastic wings of a six-pack. Marshall Eriksen, I think you know what you have to do. I have to save the planet! Is it over? I call on top. Ow! A few days later, I headed over to The Captain's building to get Zoey's box. I'm here to Ted. What a surprise. Ted. Captain. I You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly. Pssh, nah But my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study. Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas! In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative. That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out. You're welcome Earth. GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million. Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is "$12 million, " and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance. Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain. Ted, beneath this lustrous mane, I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man. Wow. Do you have any idea who it could be? The Captain then told a story much different than the one I'd been telling. But one maybe just as true. Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then enter the scoundrel. Oh, man, this movie's scary. I know, eh? I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache. Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart. Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry. And that's the last time you saw her. But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night. That's damn good brandy. But morning came, and she was gone. Oh, Captain don't blame yourself. I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this. Me. I'm the bad guy. Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero. Damn it! The box! Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation. Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own. from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that. Deal. Come on, come on. Lily! You lying little minx. 00 p. m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating. Sorry. Who said anything about an? Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver. No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten. No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite! You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship. No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great penis comes great responsibility. Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one. Sorry? I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve. Careful, Robin, I'll do it. Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place. Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back. Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after. Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well. The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting. You did meet Sting. Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million? Well, because we can always do more. Yeah, but I met Sting. Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur! Who here supports Eriksen's proposal? Well, he has some good points. Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen His father just died. nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement. Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy. No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli. Hey, baby. Yeah? What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together? Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead. Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island? Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island. Well, I do. I got to find those rings! Cwap. Hi, I'm here to pick up Hello, Ted. To the study? To the study! Mmm. Ted I know. Know what? I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is Ted when I tell you who it is, you're gonna It's my doorman! That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman? He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this! No, no, no, you can't fire him. You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution! Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop! Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?! Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion! Whoa, "rapscallion" may be going a bit far, Ted. But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that. Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they? Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey. When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman. Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't. It's me. You're welcome. Okay, baby, what gives? I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings. I hope this doesn't make me look desperate. All right, Robin, give it to me. Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, "Yeah, Barney, go get her!" But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you. The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell Is that a seven or a nine? It's a five, idiot. A fi? In what moon man language is that a five? "Moon man language"? What does that even mean? How am I supposed to see that's a five? Look how you taped this up Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make. Barney. Go get her. Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you? Well yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me. So I'm the bad guy. Great. Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things. If you say so. I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it. Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on? He'll never get to see how I turn out. What do you mean? My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know. Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family? Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever. Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet-- you know, like, a year from now-- then we'll start a family. I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me. Meeker doesn't hate you. Oh, Meeker hated him, all right. After all, Marshall was the one who got him fired. Meeker knew we all hung out at MacLaren's. So that night, he went there to confront Marshall. But as luck would have it Are you guys? Closed. Sorry. Thanks. Rough night? Yeah. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen. What did you just say? Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him? Know him? I hate that guy. Me, too. Well, hey. And the rest, as they say is history. And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon. Wow. That's a pretty good omelet. Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey? No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run. Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. Hello. Marshall. Hey, Ted. Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into. It needed a lot of work, but I had a vision for it. Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids. Ted. This is your seduction lounge. Sex swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second. We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention. Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this house you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back. Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you. Why did Barney need an intervention? It all started a few nights earlier. Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness. Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver? Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks. You call the super for a screwdriver? Yeah here's the thing about me and tools the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again. Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools. Well, here's our screwdriver now. Guys, I'm pretty sure that's not Luis, but I can't be certain. Someone introduce yourself. Barney, I I got your letter. Dad? I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now. Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff. Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned. Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental. Really? I seem to recall Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon. Um, Professor? Uh, do you mean "chameleon"?  Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced "chamma-leeon," so Class dismissed. No homework. For a while. Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it. Oh, Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of "ch-aracter" to admit that. Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? - I'll tussle. Please, no. So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months. Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist. Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus! Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right? So you want to get pizza later? Or I think we should break up. I still think about him in the shower. I think I need a drink. Me, too. Glen McKenna, neat. Nice order. Up top. Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is this is going to take me a minute. Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk? I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now. - Make a muscle. Ah! Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out. Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now. You're funny. My dad's funny. So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him. Observe. Oh, my God, that took you five seconds. Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks. You're a master. You are legen wait for it daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream. So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year. Oh, that's cool. Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg? This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. Barney, we we know you're psyched, but just be careful. What do you mean? Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear. Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt. First of all, Robin, my dad could beat up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready. I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know? Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon. You have gaps, too, Lily. You got nothing on me. Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer? Sure, honey. You have terrible aim. That's not true. Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor. Oh, my God. Barney's dad. Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right? Yeah, but aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia? What? No, I I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help Barney won't return my calls. What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together. That's not what happened. I'm not sure how to start this. Yeah. I think I need a drink. Me, too. Glen McKenna, neat. Milk, skim. Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night? I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night. Wow. I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. 30. Hey, um When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that? No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right? Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you you were this total badass. Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier. Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff. The drugs, the alcohol, the women Yes, yes, yes. I was out of control. Out of control. ♪ So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry. You ever bang Stevie Nicks? Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him, I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging. I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word "furgling. " It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, "More quiche! More quiche!" I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes. I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player. Big-time. Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate. Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the "Father Knows Breast," there's the "Bush Dynasty," the "Lick Father, Lick Son. " Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that. Why? I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly she's in college. This is my son J. J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them. You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this. I made him wait all these years for me and I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but I need another chance to connect with my son. We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away. What? You're having dinner with him tonight. No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that. Are you sure it's not more than that? Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again. No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road. Fine, I'll go. Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. And so Barney agreed to give his dad one more chance. Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit. Oh, thank you very much. And I love your coat. I love your coat. Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you. Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair. Guess now we wait. Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. real or fake?  Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f re fake? Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already. What, baby? You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died. That's not true. Robin, don't disagree with Marshall. I'm sorry. I first noticed it at the bar. Can you get me a mojito? Normally, you would've given me crap for an hour about a voice crack that pubescently girl-like, but nothing. So then I started to test you guys. The Phantom Menace is by far the best Star Wars movie. It ages well, that's the thing. You guys like my new soul patch? Righteous hair tab, brotha. And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now. I love him. Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us. But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you. Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night. J. J. , dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top. I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas. Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid. Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you. J. J. , I'm talking to Dad right now. God. Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps? Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is you can't wink. You can't swallow pills. Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person. Right? What? So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank. Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J. J. ? I'm 11. Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money. Actually, J. J. has a job. Tell him, J. J. I got a paper route. Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad? Good slam, Barney. Jerry. It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers. J. J. 's a heck of a basketball player. Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to? Fourth period? Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?! Got him again. Jerry! Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough. Why? J. J. started it. What does J. J. even stand for anyway? J Jerky Jerkface? J. J. stands for Jerome Jr. Jerome Jr? Oh. He's he's named after you. Excuse me. I like having a brother. You always add too much water to oatmeal. Yes, I drown the son of a bitch. You consistently miss at least one belt loop. It's like I'm blind. You're too old to ask to see the cockpit. Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died. Aw, honey. No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this. Barney, what is going on? This is mine. I don't understand. J. J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me. Please, just come down and talk to me. Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad. Why does that make you so mad? Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?! Look, Barney, I know I screwed up Oh, "screwed up" doesn't even begin to describe I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I I just have no idea where to begin. Can you help me with this?  Here, got it. Look, if you ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life. Bye. Are you sure you don't want to talk about it? I'm fine. Hey, Ted. Yeah, buddy? You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there? Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine. No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop. You never really know what's going on in there. So after Uncle Marshall lost his father, he decided to get his heart checked. And so did I and so did Lily and so did Robin. And then Marshall went again, just to be sure. There was only one holdout. I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple sex partners. I'm doing everything right. Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us. Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again. Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad? No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it. You wouldn't have to take care of it. Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life? Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted. Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man. Here we go. You're clearly trying to fill a hole in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. "With"? I am not "with" Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it behind Nora. I don't know. This will be your second date. Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl. Yeah. Penis feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule Barney said this a lot. if you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day. Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers. Never date a girl with a hook for a hand. Never go out with the same girl more than once. Then why are you going out with Nora again? There is an exception. And it was always the same exception. unless she's hot. unless she's hot. unless she's hot. Arr! And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself yeah, I said it, Beardy is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend Wait for it. Uh-oh. Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold. Oh, no. How long have you been sick? About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it. Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed? Huh, let's say well-endowed with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime. The bed that's where all the happens. Come on, let's get you sorted out. That night, Barney didn't take care of business. Instead, Nora took care of Barney. Ah. Thank you. Good night, Barney. Good night, Mommy. Wow, she nursed you back to health? No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me. Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. guys? Nate Scooberman. But everyone calls me Scooby. I'd love to hang out, but I really gotta hit the john. Uh, yeah, it's right in here Scooby. Thanks, brah. I like you guys. Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you. What? You told me to meet someone. I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street. Actually, I met him in the park. Should have just let you get a dog. Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist. Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared? No. Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared? Yes! Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special. Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang. Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang ♪ Bang, bang, bangity bang ♪ Are we done? A bang-bang, bangity-bang. ♪ Well, Barney, your heart sounds fine. See, Lily? She was worried. Although it seems like you might have a slight arrhythmia. Ow! Nails, nails! It's probably nothing to worry about, but I'd like you to wear this heart monitor for the next 24 hours. Twen Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight. Don't worry. It's totally safe. Unless part of your big date involves connecting yourself to a car battery. Well, now it doesn't. And exactly 24 hours later, they returned for the results. Okay, everything looks fine here, although I did notice a few irregularities. There's nothing to be alarmed about. Go on, Doctor. 46 p. m. last night? Well, let's see uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups I was at dinner. This might be a little forward, but do you have a bomb strapped to your chest? This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing. Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night. What's that like? So is everything okay? My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too. Oh, I am so sorry. Thanks. Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it. Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just No. What is it? I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora! That's exactly what I want, too. I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, "get out of here!" And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, "get out of here!" So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back. Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun. Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is. And what is he? He's a dog. He's totally a dog. What? You saw him hitting on someone? No, I didn't say, "He a dawg. " I said, "He's a dog. " As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms. Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans. Where? Okay, Scooby, you ready? Oh! Good boy, Scooby! - Good job, Scoob! - Good boy! - That last one did not happen. He dropped it. He's not a dog. Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots. Hey, guys, got my shots. You are so playful. Scooby, sit. So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted. Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you "paws. " How did you meet? Tell us the "tail"" Yes, how did you "whisker" off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter. Did you send her an e-mail, or did you "collar"? Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez. No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to "flea. " We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel. So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty "ruff. " Sure was. My part of Canada's pretty different from New York. Oh, I bet it was an "Incredible Journey"" - What part of Canada is that? Speak. This isn't happening. Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox. Hey, guys, this is Nora. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman. Well, it's still early. I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic. I had no idea he had a deep down. Oh, you should have heard him at dinner. I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids. How many do you want? Three one of each. You? Three. All in an old stone house. Yeah, with ivy growing on it. Cocktails on the patio. And we must have a pool. We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney? I really am. Unbelievable. I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here. I assure you, that's not a nickname that I And that explains your Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie. I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact I think I'm falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious. I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle. Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend. Guys, this is real. I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it. Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora. Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig? Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice. Robin. Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream The Mr. T dream I'm lost. Ted? Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book. The ballet class. I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed. The 'N Sync concert. front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got? Okay, Ted. The thermos. I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora. I do! So be cool! There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox. Sorry, toots. He's taken. So. How do you all know Barney? Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me. We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because Barney don't go to no strip clubs. Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once. Nope. Not even once. Really? So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy. I don't recall. Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So let's just drop it, all right? It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them? This was a big deal for Barney. I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents. Not even if she's hot? Not even if her mom's hot. I'd love to meet your parents. It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home? Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk. No, Scooby, you, uh stay! Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone. I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, - I'd wind up taking care of it. What do we do now? Oh! I got an idea. I was in the park today, and this guy sold me a big bag of Kids, it was a big bag of sandwiches. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore. Sandwiches make me hungry. Truth. Hey. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. I - Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing. Guys, I found this on the floor. Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Ruh-roh! Wait. Where is he, anyway? Oh, dude. Scooby got out! Here we are. I had a really great time tonight. Yeah, me, too. Do you want to come upstairs? I'd love to. There's just one little thing, and it probably doesn't matter, but I don't want to get married. I've been saying that all night just to get in your pants. Whoa! Oh! Ahh! Can you believe - Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet. Robin! Hey. Hey, um, remember Scooby? Uh, well, he got out. "Got out"? What do you mean? He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open. He must've figured out how to open it himself. He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks. I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen. Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home. Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones? Wait Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you. Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me! - I was on the spot. This is your fault. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This isn't England. Good-bye, Barney. Scooby! Scoob! - Great idea. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go? Of course. Back to the pizza place! Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went. Who's Scooby? - Hey, guys. 51 a. m. Okay. None of this suggests a systemic issue. Your heart's fine. With a healthy diet, you can live a long and happy life. If nobody stabs you. Day's not over. Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down. No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do. Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another 32 years. I mean Nora's great. She's wonderful. 30. 30? It literally skipped a beat. Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it? - I lied. When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you. Mom, Dad this is Barney. Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick? Problem was, some people didn't want The Arcadian torn down. Even bigger problem, they were led by my girlfriend Zoey. 00 at Valenzisi's? That's great! I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait! But somehow, Zoey and I were making it work. Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner. Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face? She wants it. Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this? Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve. You guys are in screaming matches all the time. Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches. It was true. Zoey and I loved to challenge each other. The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV! Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant! Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies. No, you hang up. No, you hang up. No, you hang up. No, you hang up. No, you hang up! No, you hang up. No, you hang up. No, you Hold on. Hello? For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone? Why would you do that?! I-I thought you'd like it. Who likes that? I like it. Your relationship sounds exhausting. Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy. Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch. How I Met Your Mother 6x20 ♪ The Exploding Meatball Sub Original Air Date on April 11, 2011 Now around this time, Marshall had truly come to hate his job. He hated the paperwork. He hated the coffee. He hated the dirty jokes. He hated everything. I have to quit. Quit GNB?! Why? I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes. Baby, you have my full support. Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning. Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids. I don't think you know what Spain is. Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira. It's dinero. Where? I want his autograph! So Marshall walked in the next morning all ready to quit. But then something weird happened. I will remember you ♪ Suddenly, he didn't hate the paperwork. He didn't hate the coffee. He didn't even hate the dirty jokes. Out of nowhere, Marshall actually liked GNB. It's graduation goggles. What? Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated. The guy who was basically a dog? He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him I will remember you ♪ I suddenly got kind of wistful. He was a good boy. Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having sex with a woman, at first, I never want to see her again. But then I will remember you ♪ No, that's pretty much it. The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer. You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB. No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees! Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall. I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey. It starts with an "L?" How can you not remember my name? It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time. Well, they don't do that all the time. Yes, they do. No, they don't. Yes, they do. It's like they don't see eye-to-eye on anything! Totally. Totally. It rhymes with your name. And I said my name was? Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job. Oh, good for you, sweetie. Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right? Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving? Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play "Who's Hot and Who's Scott?" It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall ruined everything. Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined. Guys, everything's ruined. What? Why? Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck. so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious. I'm furiously enjoying being challenged. Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little murder-suicidey? Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is killing you? It's not. Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, "What about my trip to Spain, deadbeat?" Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, "Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?" We take turns! Sometimes. Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC. I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today. Hershel? What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall taller than Marshall and he knows way more laws. Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker. There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games? Barney, I'm not playing Just come back to GNB already! I'm really loving my new job. Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy. I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right? Baby, you have my full support. Thanks, baby. Oh. Ooh, I gotta go. The invitations are ready. The party's for a bunch of environmentalists, so I found a guy downtown who makes biodegradable party invitations that can also be used as toilet paper. That's how I'm gonna use mine. Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB? Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better. Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall? Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. "Barney, we have to talk about your father. " "Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil. " "Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session "between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute. " I don't need this! Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. Your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? Perfect. Let's go. Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe I don't know if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today? Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't. Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time. Oh, my God! How long have you been there? You don't remember? Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day. Oh, no, I'm fine. Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch? Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us? Yeah. Right. So, um Chinese? You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple. You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy. But I thought you liked being challenged. Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?! Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12? You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. TED There he is. Here we go. I'm sorry. I don't speak whatever it is you're speaking. Um, he speaks perfect English. Yeah, I-I know. Then why did you ask me to come? So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho. W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain? You were right. If I hear myself say "Baby, you have my full support" one more time, I swear I'm gonna murder someone! What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back? I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time bomb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode! Wow, tha that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U. S. A. ! Okay, Lily, I get it. Marshall's been asking a lot lately. But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough. I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids. Lil Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. My bag? Oh, no. I got it. There's nothing to talk about. You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad. I don't want to talk about it, okay? Why not? Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything. I've never told anyone this before. Um I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and haven't talked about it since. But sometimes on a still night you can still hear that clock, ticking ticking ticking. That's the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true? No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts. Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is is Hey. the meatball sub. Huh? It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day. Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life. Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there. I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. You want to make God laugh, tell him your plans, right? What is wrong with you? Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming. Oh, my pleasure. I have to use the restroom. Do you have some extra invitations? Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up. Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um What? Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily Lily Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry. Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil? Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something. No, you know what? Me, too. Um I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think? Baby, you have my full support. Oh Ted. Hey! What are you doing here? This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support. This you can be supportive of?! What is that supposed to mean? I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to kill that dream? My girlfriend! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed? And in that moment, I realized, though I really cared about Zoey, I couldn't do this for the next 50 years. I had to break up with her. But then I will remember you ♪ Will you remember me ♪ Kids, some couples always support each other, and some couples always challenge each other, but is one really better than the other? Yes. Support is better. Way better. But I'd have to learn that the hard way. You're too young. This isn't fair. We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end. Thank you, Marshall. Marshall can I ask one final favor, my friend? Yes, of course, of course anything. Eat this meatball sub. Wh-Where'd you get a meatball I don't have much time! Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning? I'm not sick, you idiots! I've racked up $30,000 of uninsured medical bills for symptoms I don't even have. Totally worth it! You should see the look on your face. Oh, wait, you can't 'cause it's covered in marinara sauce! Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas. Goliath National Bank Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference. Which made Marshall's big interview with a respected environmental organization all the more confusing. I'm sorry. I don't think you're the kind of person we're looking for. I just got off the phone with Arthur Hobbs over at GNB. Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen at least I did when he actually showed up. 30. If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it if you'd try to get here at least before lunch. Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass. Oh! Mr. Eriksen You're not wearing any pants. Your move. Screw the environment! We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent racist. Sir, none of that is Sorry. Interview over. And so Marshall stormed over to GNB, where he ran into Zoey. If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you. The Arcadian As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to "Hot For Teacher. " Barney! Barney! Bar No, no. I'm going to go coyote. Wait. Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down. Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples Dude, that's my girlfriend. Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside? You know it. Ha-ha! Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down. Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend. we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company. So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject? Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often. Hey! Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian. So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like? ? How I Met Your Mother 6x22 ? The Perfect Cocktail Original Air Date on May 2, 2011 Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now? Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down. Yeah, totally. So, they found water on Mars. What? Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right? Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day? That was on purpose! What now? I mean this is really like Barney, please And thus began an all-out war between Barney and Marshall Delivery from Mr. Stinson. Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?! Oh! ? Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! ? Later, back at the bar another war was just beginning. Babe, can I get you a drink? No, I'm still not ready to put my mouth on anything yet. I know. You know what? Screw this. Game on. Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by. That bitch is not giving us the walk-by. The walk-by with the stink eye. A stink-eye-walk-by?! Aw, hell no! I hope this drink isn't teething, 'cause it's about to get nursed. Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy! No. I' was I was This went on for days. Congratulations. You're about to be the 250th girl that Barney has slept with. Pfff. Try 283. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. Oh, bye-bye. Mr. Stinson I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. Oh, boy. Look who's back. Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave or stay here Lionel Richie style-- "All Night Long"? Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho. Oh! Ah, yes the sweet, smoky taste of victory. Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else? That's it! Kent! Kent! Oh, God! Ow Why would you do that to your own jacket?! That's what you get, you traitor! Oh, really? Really? Yeah. Really. Really. That what Okay, enough! You guys are out of here. Ejected! I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out! Carl! Oh This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. Don't look, baby. Just don't look. Come on. This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah. Man, what are we going to do without her? Oh Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk. Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine? Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity. Ten, nine, eight I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that. Happy New Year! If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin. Oh last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night. Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror. How about martinis? Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini. Why not? Ooh You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out. Every time. I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid Uh-huh. Oh, yeah? Well what about you and absinthe? I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having. I keep telling you, that didn't happen. It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris? Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris he gets really into how beautiful he is. Hey. I dare you guys to dare us to make out. Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right? Peppermint schnapps? No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson. Who? The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth. Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm Beautiful. Mmm Hey, where are our chicken wings? Show me chicken wings! Good order, Ted! Good order! Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday. Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol? Bourbon. When I drink bourbon I get weirdly good at beatboxing. Peace, I'm out. Yes! Yes! Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you. ? Ki-ki, ki-ki, ki-ki, ki-ki ? ? Ka-ka, ka-ka, ka-ka, ka-ka ? ? Koo-koo, koo-koo, koo-koo, koo-koo, poo poo ? Poo! Peace. I'm out. You had to take that away from me, didn't you? Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's. What do you mean? Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth. Stop. Man, how did things get so screwed up? Of course I knew the answer to that. I was dating her. But I wasn't about to ruin our first big romantic weekend away by bringing up the one topic we agreed was completely off-limits. You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What? I thought we weren't talking about We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me? Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him? Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur. You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel. Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all. Okay. We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation? Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right? I-I guess. That seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight. Do you know what I had to do to get you that job? Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day? What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like? I showed up with wet hair once! Once! Oh, my God. Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side. You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow. That's not a chocolate. Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest. Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah. See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me. Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that Oh God, I didn't even think of that It made me wonder, "What could I have done to make him stay?" Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney. That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me. Wow. That got real o'clock. Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun. Dance, my puppets, dance! Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives? Oh, God, totally! Mm. Please? Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Care to join me? Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute? What are What are you doing in our bathroom? WOMAN This bathroom for entire floor! Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other? Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right? Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots. What? What is it? What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now? Your place or mi Your place or mi Le-Let's go to your place. Mm. Kids, don't drink tequila. Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having sex next door with a third very small man. I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty. Okay. What is it? And don't give me, "It's beautiful. " Don't give me, "It's magnificent"" What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it? Well When I was a little girl my family used to live here. Why, why have you never told me that? I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but The truth is, I I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too. I love you. I love you, too. Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up. Well, what drink finally did the trick? Of course, beer. Beer. I love you. I love you. Uh, no. N-Not right You know, I guess this place isn't so bad. See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former What was that? What was what? I think it went under the bed. Yeah. I don't see anything. That, that was that! Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse! The what? Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it. Ew. I give up. You win. Let's go! Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them. Morning. Who wants breakfast? You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face? Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy! I thought they made up last night. Damn it, I know what happened. I love you. I love you. Uh, no. N-not right Carl, a round of champagne. Ooh! The champagne. We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing. What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone? Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too. Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted Okay, what drink can fix this? Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me? I got it. Right? Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make What is that? Your buzz kill of a ma thinks I'm a a bad influence on you. What? That's What is that word you taught me? "Bull" something? But she's your mother and I'm you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you. But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be Led-and-Jerry. Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend? A drunk audience. Attaboy. You still got that button from the festival we went to? Now I'm gonna put this right inside your brain, behind your ear so that I'll know that you won't forget me. See you, buddy. And hey Never stop partying. Kids, in 1983, Barney watched his father walk out of his life. And in 2011, when their first reunion ended badly I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life. This time it was Barney who did the walking. Bye. And that was almost the end of it. Except, a few weeks later I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess. Mmm. Your dad? My dad! Barney Stinson. Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J. J. on Sunday morning? Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years. Barney, look I know you're disappointed that your dad is just a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be-- "Crazy Jerry"? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right? You do not know how right you are. Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything. You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year. I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues. Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs. Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys! Do any of you know George Clooney? Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight. That's why you brought these guys. No. That's why I brought these guys. I've made some minor improvements to your identities. Uh. Mm! You'll find them on these cards. Yeah. Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of Okay, let's see the cards. Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Mm! Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage. Whoo-hoo! Gross! Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself. Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about. Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, "Man is least himself when he talks" Ted, card. Ah. You're right-- "No quoting Oscar Wilde. " Finally Robin, you're dating Ted. I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, "Why don't you marry Robin? "You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. " Uh  no, thanks. Hey, Barney-- love the new identities. Little thing-- instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada? How good was that movie? Oh, my God. And hence new identities. And so Barney's dad finally showed up. Jerry, you remember Marshall-- he's a well-known writer. Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet. Lily, his wife. Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time. That's a little depressing. Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend. Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again. Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band. Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong Um, those places shut down a long time ago. Oh, no. Oh, No shut down, too. There's Where? Where's Where? Where's where Was was, isn't it? No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right? Okay. Not Okay. That place is lame. Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong? That's wrong. That's not Wrong. Guys, focus. Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there. Where? Not Where. Focus. I thought Focus was closed. No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed. So Closed is open. No, Closed is closed. I don't know. Third base! Right? Ew, Third Base is all frat guys. I'll go anyplace, okay? Not Okay. Okay is lame. Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar. Guys, shut up. No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore. Okay is Lame! Gay bar. For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lamé. Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters. I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard! I might be allergic to this stamp. Oh, my God, my secret crush is here. Mila Kunis?! No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago. Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me? Uh no. The only good thing about how ugly that shirt is, is that it distracts from how terribly it fits you. I was trying on the pants. Oh. I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello. Hi. A few years ago at a department store, Hi. did you embarrass the hell out of me? Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day. I should be so lucky. Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you. Right. Um it was really nice to see you again. Mm-hmm. You, too. Yeah. You owe me one. Man, isn't this place great? Uh, I don't know. It's so loud! And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about a frozen yogurt shop. Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage. Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo shoots and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model. My goodness! I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even. Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day. Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job! I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your "real job. " I won a Tony! I brought French cooking to America! What? Let's do shots. Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J. J. early tomorrow. I-I better take it easy. No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? "Never stop partying. " I said that? To a six-year-old? I don't remember that. You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well you know, why don't you just go back home? But I want to hang out with you. Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome. Fine. You want Crazy Jerry? There! You got him! I apologize-- it might take a few minutes to kick in. Whoo! Wa-hah! Can you believe it? This is awesome! Barney, how is that awesome? ♪ I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad. So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me? Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy and reaching for stuff. Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have sex in the bathroom. But if you can score five numbers before me, then we have sex in the bathroom. So our usual wager. Deal. Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y-you really want to be out here like this? Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing? No, of course not. I-I just Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York! Yeah! Let's do it! Yeah! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party! Okay, Jerry's gone; let's break up. Okay. "I would have stolen you a whole orchestra. " There. What's the rush? Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up? Really? That guy? He was, like, a four. A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you? Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight and a half. You're a doofus and a half. Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway? At a close-out sale at Dawes. Really? I remember that sale. Hey, Robin. Oh, Ted. Oh, no. Look what I just bought. Right? Right? Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great sex that night. Great sex. Let me guess. Someone wants to knock boots. Boots. Just take off your damn shirt. Okay. All right. All right. Whoa, stop. What? Stop. Perfect. But I-I can't see, and you can't see me. Yeah. Yeah, just like that. You were picturing your crush! Well, somebody had to. Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever to do with the boots? Yes. You hear that, everybody? She said "yes"! We're getting married!  I love this girl. I'm never letting her go. After that, Barney's memory of the night got a little hazy. Hey, hey! There we go!  Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry. It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk! What? I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So I used a little sleight-of-hand to make you think otherwise. Here you go. Mm. But all those crazy things you did. Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is? A drunk audience. You want to fight me? Well, I'll fight you, dummy! No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here! Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground! Oh!  police car. Well, why do all those things? I figured if I showed you what "never stop partying" really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever. Oh, well. You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy! I wanted to hang out with you-- you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J. J. on that fishing tri-- Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now. Hey, you know, a-a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs. Perhaps. Well, here's something you didn't know-- I'm a pretty good magician, too. Congratulations! Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. Yeah, okay. Wow. Wardrobe malfunction at the O. K. Corral! I mean, who in their right mind would ever You would look so totally hot in those. Do you have these in a size 11? So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint. Hello. I, uh Oh. Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number? We need someplace to hide. Where? No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs. Well, uh I do have a few driving students in the city. Step on it! Jerry Do not step on it. Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip. the laws are there to protect This is no time for laws! Buckle up, Barney. I am not going to buckle up! I am your father! You will listen to me! Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers? I won that race. My prize-- sex in the bathroom. And I won that race. Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you. Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be. Why are you smiling? I don't know. Good night. Saw that girl again. And guess what? She's engaged. So that's the end of that. It wasn't the end of that. More on that later. And her fiancé? The guy's like a two. How did you do it? Do what? How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs You're drifting. Hey, I'm trying to open up to you No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney. When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and I'm too far gone. I'm broken. Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong-- settling down is a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life. So how do you do it? A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow. Maybe I've met her already. And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat. Maybe some other time. Okay. Oh, and, uh thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years. I'm going fishing with my dad. This sucks. Goliath National Bank was finally ready to demolish The Arcadian and build the new headquarters I'd designed for them. Ho! The only problem was-- I kept butting heads with my project supervisor on one very important issue. I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian! I want to press it! I want to press it! I want to press it! Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, "Baby, that was great"" and go to sleep. She means you. She means you. I want to press it. I want to press it! I'm gonna press it! I'm gonna press it! It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please? Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday. Oh. Oh. That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing? I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates. Saving money. Making new friends. No downside. They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win. Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should I'll let you go. Hey. You want to get coffee sometime? You know that "coffee" is code for "I want to get back together" right? Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking. I want to get back together. Oh! Oh! Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time. You know what might make you feel better, buddy? I'm not letting you press the button. I want to press the button! You're not pressing the button! It's my button! Sadly, that's all you need to know about my summer. Now, around this time, Uncle Marshall was still having a tough time finding a job. He's out printing out a whole new batch of r�sum�s because he misspelled the phrase "detail-oriented. " And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him. Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time? Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, "Get sick, get a free gallon of soup"" And so, Lily dropped off Marshall's surprise soup and headed back to work to introduce the new class pet. This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with Marshall! Don't eat the soup! Oh, thank God. This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup? ? How I Met Your Mother 6x24 ? Challenge Accepted Original Air Date on May 16, 2011 Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh? Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend-- wait for it-- dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent! You okay? Yeah no. This morning I was talking to the foreman. Hey, hotshot. You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted. Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be in your big, hotshot building, hotshot. What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes-- what are we dealing with here? There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks? Not possible. Your building is new. New is always better. You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules. Ah, but "new is always better" is my oldest rule, which makes it the best. Hi, Marsh. Oh, hey, buddy. Hey. Everything okay? Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it doesn't look good. I tried to be supportive. Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please? Of course, baby. But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalape�o poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to Hey, babe. The gang says feel better. Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you? Um, I Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say "under the weather," or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things. I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea. I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now. I bet it's her tushie. I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions-- enough already, Ted! That button's mine! Yeah, fine, okay. I got you this job, so I Say what? Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. You Hello? Yes, it is. It's Bloom, Greenberg and Associates. They want me to come interview. Yes, I know it's risky to go, but this is the best environmental law firm in New York. It's my dream job. That's a great idea, babe. I'll ask them. 00. Thank you. I love and believe in you, too, baby. Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. "See you in an hour. " Who's that from? Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her! Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great. After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back. No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs. Uh, Ted's gone back for less. Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime? Bro. Ted, I only have one rule. But I can't reach the worst part. Hi, Karen. Coming up next, our two local pandas, Ming Ming and Bao Bao, are expecting a baby. Robin, you want to get coffee sometime? Get it together, bro. 00 p. m. , my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time. Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early? Don't worry. I'll be prepared. I'm talking your ear off, sorry. Is there anything I can do for you, sweetie? Can I borrow an adult diaper? We've got to stop Ted. 00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection. " Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey. Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection. Aw, that's sweet. You weren't listening either? I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap? Lily! Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch. Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues. Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom blowing my nose-- I have the sniffles. Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us you're exploding from both ends like a busted fire hydrant. Damn it, Marshall. Anyway, listen, I was going to get back together with Zoey today, but I came to my senses on the way out here, so False alarm. Oh, crap. Just stepped in some gum. I'm getting back together with Zoey! Okay, we're never gonna find him. Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor. Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us Got it. Ted's at Oh Ted's at Smith and Ninth Street. That's the intersection. That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time? Way ahead of ya. Hello! Marshall. Jake Bloom. Great to meet you. Hello, hi. Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train. I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey. I know. They're a total train wreck. Unmitigated disaster. Worst couple ever. Yeah, almost as bad as us. We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched. What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra. You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated. Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that? I guess I get it. What do you mean? Well, no matter how bad things got Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he? Yeah he did. And she loved him, too. Didn't she? Yeah, she did. Smith and Ninth Street. So, let me show you some of the gut-wrenching environmental atrocities that we were working to stop, okay? Here, pop quiz. What is that? That's a seal. Bingo! Yes, a bloated seal corpse rotting in industrial waste. Mm-hmm. Now, wait till you see what we found when we cut him open. Okay, where the hell are they? Maybe this isn't the intersection. Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner. I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so whatever. Wait. Where'd you get that? Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys want to buy some weed or? She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted? Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again? Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid. Thanks, Julia! You know what? Let me see the pink lady slipper again. Now, do you know what that is? A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge. Being eaten by rats. Exactly. Now this next slide Oh, I'm sorry. That's my wife's water birth. I don't know how that got in there. Anyway, that's all my questions. Oh, my God, I made it! Now just shake his hand, clench your very soul and run like hell! Now, I like to set aside of every interview for your questions. So don't hold back. Whatever you got inside there, you just let 'er rip. I can't do this anymore. I'm just gonna tell him the truth. When it's stomach stuff, you just say "under the weather" or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things. I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends! Nailed it. Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. Ooh! Come on. What the hell?! You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb. I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it! Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting. But it's a mistake. You're right. Um, excuse me. Can you give this to the blonde sitting alone in there and tell her Ted's really sorry? Also indirect sunlight. Don't overwater. Half a cup a week is more than enough. No. Hi. And kids that's how I met your mother. Psych. It was just some chick. Hey, baby, how'd it go? Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job. The good news is, in a few seconds, I'm gonna start heaving my guts out because that's what life is for me now; just losing what's inside until I'm just empty. Baby, come here. I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. And Marshall slept all night. Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors? He is. You sure? Yeah. You earned it. All clear! Hey, new is always better, right? Always. Ten, nine, eight Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick. I know, baby. I'm pregnant. one! ? Let it roll across the floor ? ? Through the hall and out the door ? ? To the fountain of perpetual birth ? I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot. It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please? Nora. Hi. How you been? Fine. Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book. I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes. I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses. It's never too late, Barney. Challenge accepted. Best man? You're being summoned. Geez, what now? I heard the groom needed me. What do you think of this tie? There are certain moments in life when you have to decide which things you can stand to see torn down, and which things you have to preserve, no matter what. Such a moment came for all of us in May of 2011, at a special meeting of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, where the fate of The Arcadian would be decided once and for all. A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well Did you like that? All right, uh We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size If you want New York's history at your beck and call All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen. I just have We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? Okay, it's killing me. What rhymes with "beck and call?" Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball. Ah Thank you. How I Met Your Mother 6x23 ♪ Landmarks Original Air Date on May 9, 2011 Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question. Actually, it was a difficult question. Of course, had he asked me a few days earlier, I would have immediately said "Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark. " And then the crowd "Oh, my God! "Did he really just say that? "Oh, heavens! "Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!" So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies? Almost exclusively. If they ask GNB's chief architect-- aka me-- if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say "yes"? That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian. I'm sorry, I should have been more clear. Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like Nice. I have a message from Barney. Things between Barney and the rest of us had gotten a little frosty. First this happened. Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian. And then this happened. What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?! Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too. Which led to this happening. Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. Love you, too. Good night. Good night. All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs ( . ) ( . ) Yeah, I have that, too. Damn it. All right, here's the message. "Oh, hey, guys. Didn't see you there. "I was too busy feelin' fine and" Really? "Feelin' fine and gettin' some 'jine. " "You may have noticed the giant plate "of hot wings in front of me. "I know how much you love hot wings. "Too bad someone bribed the kitchen "to take them off the menu tonight. "So, if you want some, "you're going to have to come back to GNB. "But hurry, this offer will be gone lickety-split. " "Do evil laugh. " Oh, um So, what are you turds up to? Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on. Why does it need to rhyme? Mm. If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time. Yeah. If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor. And she hasn't since. No. Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do? Nailed it. Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me? It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands. I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits. What? Zoey's lady bits are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross. I once knew such a girl. It was last call. In this very bar. What?! No What?! No What?! Um thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story. Barney, this is about the building. Come on. This is so about the girl. Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there's a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia. Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia? Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry. Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You will be. That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now. Now, kids, you remember Arthur Hobbs, Barney and Marshall's old boss at GNB? Well, Arthur was going through a divorce and taking it kind of hard. Hi, Arthur. Everything okay? No, everything's not okay. Tugboat God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement. Isn't that animal cruelty? I'm talking about my wife. Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect? Yeah, I know your friend Ted. So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark you wouldn't just fire him, would you? Right? You wouldn't just You wouldn't just yeah No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you. Come again for Big Fudge? Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot. I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you? I don't understand. Why would you fire me? Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job? By being the best architect available? No. By being Latino? No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room. Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me. Damn it! I was kidding? I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife? Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done. Damn it! No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down. They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job. And he's been doing it for years. Okay, what does Barney do at GNB? No idea. He has a lot of keys. Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now. Okay, Ted you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess Okay, I play online. But the key to chess Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario. The chairman asks you Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? You say No. And Zoey dumps you on the spot. We're done here. There's the second scenario. The chairman asks you Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? You say Yes And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her. We're done here. You said there was a third scenario. Right. The chairman asks you Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? But before you can answer You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you. That one's less likely. What I'm saying what I hate saying is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's. Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle Tree? Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times. I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this. Thank you. I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this. Thank you. John Clifford Larrabee And I am visiting you in a dream Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time. Look, it's a dream, it is. do not try to save The Arcadian. Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out. I am not Barney Whoa! Lighting change! This guy. Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it. Or looks at it. Or smells it. New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn. The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it? Indeed. You realize this kind of screws up my personal life. Mo' buildings, mo' problems. This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted. Dream! Dream! It was just a dream. ♪ Hey. I know it's late, but, uh you want to meet up? Hello, Mr. Lion. "Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair" Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right here. As far as you know, I still could be one. Ah. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab. Worth every penny. All right this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun. Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save. Exactly. You okay? Yeah. Good night. Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark? No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them. E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? TED The Arcadian should be a landmark. It should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads. Oh, heavens! My stars! Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby? Yeah, that's me. This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place. Yeah. We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head. Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes. What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar. We should totally buy a bar! We should absolutely totally buy a bar! It's really the only sensible idea right now. Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. Mm! It's a courtroom. Yes! Ah! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes. I'll allow it! The only court where you show up, then get served. Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers. That's not bad. Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution. Lily, it's over. The good guys lost. I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here and watch it happen. And she's got it! Lily, what's the plan? Oh, this ought to be good. And then Lily told us her plan. Oh, this is good! We have to find Arthur right now. What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league! Hey, Arthur! Oh, cute dog! No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time! Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save not saving The Arcadian. Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat! Uh Hey, Arthur? I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So so what's the idea? Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button. Dibs. Dibs. Fine! What's the idea? Well Kids, for legal reasons, I have to skip this part of the story and jump ahead to the next night, as the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave their verdict. Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework disappeared. So that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied. Zoey Zoey! All right, what do you have to say for yourself? I don't know. Sometimes things have to fall apart to make way for better things. We're done here. Timing is everything. For example, I never would met your mother if it weren't for a wedding. The last wedding I ever thought I'd be at. What do you think of this tie? Oh, thank God. Barney Stinson needs you right before his wedding, you assume there's at least one dead hooker in the closet, right? Is this one better? Look, the tie is great, and, you know, it's perfectly normal to have some pre-wedding jitters. I'm not having jitters. It just occurs to me that once I put this tie on, I can never take it off. I have to wear this tie forever and ever. And sure, this tie's skinny now, but what happens if it gets fat and starts bossing me around? Did I make a mistake? Would I have been happier with the other tie? Ted, can I tell you a big secret? Yeah, of course. I'm not really talking about the tie. No, I got that, Barney. I wonder if this whole thing's a disaster. What if this is the worst wedding ever? Not possible. We've already been to the worst wedding ever. Punchy's wedding. Marshall really took a two flusher on that one. The story of how Uncle Marshall ruined my friend Punchy's wedding starts in September, 2011. Punchy had asked me to be his best man. Hey. Hey. Guys, before we go, would you mind reading my wedding toast? Oh, yeah, no problem. Sure. Um, all right, if I have to. All right. Whoa. There's a few different versions. Ted, why are you working so hard on this toast? Punchy belched his proposal through a karaoke mic at a bowling alley. Okay, look, I've never told you guys this, but over the years, a few of my old high school buddies have asked me to give wedding toasts, and they haven't gone great. Somehow those weddings all fell smack-dab in the worst moments of my life. Joel and Mora's love is a beautiful thing. I thought I had that till my fiancée left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about this, so I won't. I sit outside her house at night sometimes. She got a haircut. After I lost my job last week, uh, I was asked not to give this toast No, no, no! The happy couple needs to hear this. Things end. But from the ashes of your statistically probable divorce, hope can rise anew. That is why I'm starting my own architecture firm-- Mosbius Designs. Mosbius Designs has failed. But Alex and Jessica's love reminds us that Oh, God! Classic Schmosby. Whoa. Punchy posted the low points of your life online? Oh, not just that. Mosbius Designs has failed ♪ But Alex and Jessica's love reminds us that ♪ Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha ♪ Oh, God! So now I seem like a total train wreck to all my old high school friends. And a bunch of people in Finland. The auto-tune thing got kind of big over there. That's why I have to nail this toast. Ted, you want to nail something at this wedding-- lose the Trapper Keeper. The only thing you need to bring to Cleveland is this. That fall I became the youngest architect in the history of New York to break ground on a skyscraper. Which led to a glowing magazine feature. I planned on having it framed-- Uncle Barney had different plans. Here's your toast-- "Single file, ladies. No fatties"" That's ridiculous. Yeah, you're right. It's Cleveland. "Single file, ladies"" How I Met Your Mother 7x01 ♪ The Best Man Original Air Date on September 19, 2011 I'm not going to Punchy's wedding to brag about a magazine cover. Barney, he doesn't need dating advice from you. You never even called Nora. Kids, you remember Nora. But just the other day I'll call you. It's never too late, Barney. Or did you call her? Not that I care. Did you? I don't care. Did you? I haven't called her. Buddy. Damn it, Barney. I was really, really, really rooting for you two. Who wants hot wings? I'm in. Or maybe we should just pour hot sauce on Barney, since he's a total chicken. I did not chicken out. Nora is looking for something serious. I'm not. End of story. And yes, Robin, I would love some wings. Cannibal. Okay, next round's on me. Oh, no, we got it. No, no Now Lily and Marshall had just found out they were having a baby. I can't wait to tell everyone. Baby, no, we can't tell anyone. Not until three months. I don't want to jinx it. That's a bit superstitious, don't you think? Whenever we board a flight, you lick the plane. Have we crashed even once? Don't say a word until we know everything's okay. Deal? Deal. But everything's just going to be great. I promise. How can you guarantee that? Come here. I'm just so happy. I don't know how we're going to keep this secret for three months. Relax. It'll be easy. What'll you have? Four beers, plus one non-alcoholic. You're pregnant! Get in here! And so we all headed to my hometown where we planned to celebrate Punchy's big day. Uncle Barney had different plans. Get ready, Cleveland. The last man to screw you this hard then disappear was LeBron James. You're trying to get laid here? What? God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between Ted's annoying friend and what's-her-face. Have some respect. This isn't just getting laid. This is market research. You see, my legendary success rate of 83% the inverse. doesn't happen by accident. Every single play I run on women has been meticulously field-tested. By weeding out the bad plays in smaller markets like Cleveland, I know which ones will work in New York. For example, tonight marks the inaugural flight of the escaped manslaughterer. Are escaped manslaughterers sexy? Not even remotely. No. No. Exactly. We'll never know unless I try it out tonight. Schmosby! Oh! Turd-faces! What's up?! You really feel that ring now. So glad you all made it. Open bar. Drink up, turd-faces, 'cause Kelly's dad's paying for all this, and he hates my guts. It's true. Who's doing shots? Come on, let's go. Oh, no, thank you. What are you pregnant or something? Let's get hammered! You're drinking for two tonight, baby. I will do this for the child. Yowza! Escaped manslaughterers-- not sexy. Although in hindsight, that was kind of a flawed concept. Next up, patient zero. Lily, we are getting sloshed tonight. That's all you, baby. I'll be four shots in with no food. In nine months, I'll be pushing a pumpkin-headed Eriksen baby out of my hoo-ha. I think Papa can manage a few extra cocktails. Well played. Hakuna Matata! I, uh, I got to get some air. Kids, remember how I told you Marshall ruined Punchy's wedding? That wasn't it. God, will you look at that guy. I wish Barney were my boyfriend again. No, thanks. Wait a minute. That's your truth voice. My what? Whenever you're trying to pass something off as a joke but it's actually profoundly true, you use that voice. I wish the Spice Girls would get back together. They were awesome. The worst. That was me. I totally cut one. That guy. Birthday present from my dad. All I really want is for him to tell me that he loves me. Just kidding. This pen's enough. It's not enough. It's totally enough. Oh, my God. You still have feelings for Barney. Admit it, you still have feelings for Barney. You are drunker than I thought. I mean, look at the guy. Wait, wait, wait. Before you go, please answer the following survey to help me better bang you in the future. What didn't work for you about this play? Did you A) not believe I was a Guinness Book world record holder? or B) did the fingernails gross you out? Th I can't wait for your toast, Schmosby. Yeah, here come the waterworks. Wait. You're rooting for me to melt down at your own wedding? Yeah, everyone is. Plus a few new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos. Good luck, good luck. Take it. Show them how awesome you are. Shamelessly plug yourself, so you can shamelessly plug, let's say that. I told you, I'm not here to brag, okay? That's it. You're too polite to brag. Well, fine. Let me. Because the only person on Earth who loves Ted Mosby more than Marshall Eriksen, is drunk Marshall Eriksen. So game on. Kids, remember how I told you Marshall ruined Punchy and Kelly's wedding? That wasn't it either. Barney and I tried and failed. That was two years ago. Why would I ever go down that road again? It wouldn't even make sense. It doesn't have to make sense. It's chemistry. Look, I've always had a sixth sense about these things. And now that I'm pregnant with this idea in my mind-uterus, I see things even clearer. You and Barney have the kind of chemistry that just doesn't go away. Really? Then why is he trying to LeBron anything that moves? Did this not work for you because A) vampires are played out, or B) claiming that I also invented Facebook was kind of a hat on a hat? You're the reason he never called Nora. You're the reason he's only test-marketing tonight. And you're the reason he keeps striking out on purpose. Chemistry. Whoa! Ted! Is that really you on the cover of New York magazine? Now, you say "yes"" Please stop. Schmosby. What's this about a magazine? You know what, Clay? It's no big deal. You know what? It is a big deal. Clay, my friend Ted is designing a skyscraper, Clay. What have you been up to, Clay? Well, I'm still working at the rental car company Bravo, bravo, Clay. Any major publications want to write an article on your sweet rental car gig? No, no articles. My life's pretty dull. I guess the only news is this little gal. Oh, my God, wook at the wittle baby. She is so cute. All I want to do is put her little feet in my mouth. You've created something truly beautiful. She is my everything. I mean, it's kind of a big deal the building, you know? Hey, little one. So, this little angel's already sleeping through the night? I've had some sleepless nights designing this building. Aw Nothing symbolic about that. Let it go. There is no chemistry left between me and Barney. We're done. Oh really? Prove it. Go tell him. Why would I go tell him that? Because deep down, even if he isn't aware of it himself, Barney wants to be with you. And if it's not gonna happen, he deserves to know. Fine. Barney, just so everything is crystal clear I know what you're gonna say. Let's show Cleveland how it's done. The chills that you spill up my back ♪ Leave me filled with satisfaction ♪ When we're done, satisfaction of what's to come ♪ I couldn't ask for another ♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh ♪ Now I couldn't ask for another ♪ Groove is in the heart ♪ Groove is in the heart ♪ Groove is in the heart ♪ Ask your mama ♪ Groove is in the heart ♪ One, two, three ♪ Groove is in your heart ♪ Groove is in the heart ♪ Groove is in the heart ♪ Groove is in the heart ♪ Groove is in the heart. ♪ Barney I Sorry. Oh, my God, it's Nora. Nora's finally calling me back. Wait, you said you never called her. I lied. I called her, like, five times. Wait, wait! You of all people know how much I suck at these things. You gotta help me. Please? Just once I would like to see what it feels like to not screw things up. Yeah, mm-hmm. Okay. Hey, Nora. Thanks for calling me back. Um, hey, hi. The-the-the reason that, um, I called is, uh To tell you how I feel about you. to tell you how I feel about you. I know we didn't work out the first time I know we didn't work out the first time and I know it doesn't make any sense and I know it doesn't make any sense but I can't shake the feeling that we belong together. but I can't shake this feeling that we belong together. Is there any part of you that wants to try again? Is there any part of you that wants to try again? Baby, I can't take it anymore. I've gotta tell somebody that we're pregnant. Eriksen, stay strong. We're keeping this secret. There's babies everywhere. It's like a minefield of cuteness. Look at this little bastard. Marshall, stop it. Stay strong. You can't let holding some, some little baby oh, with the cute little cheeks and the the little arms and little legs This son of a bitch has knee dimples. Let's go tell everyone I'm pregnant. Yeah! You okay? Nope. You? Not excessively. You want to talk about it? Not even a little. Might make you feel better. you go first, and then I'll stick with my thing about not talking about it. Okay. All my friends from high school, they're here with their wives, their kids. Me? My date for the night is a sticky magazine. Sounds like high school all over again. Sorry, it was right there. I used to believe in destiny, you know? I'd go to the bagel place, see a pretty girl in line reading my favorite novel, whistling the song that's been stuck in my head all week and I'd think, "Wow. Hey, maybe she's the one. " Now I think, "I just know "that bitch is gonna take the last whole-wheat everything bagel. " You've just been focused on work. No, it's more than that. I've stopped believing. Not in some depressed, "I'm gonna cry during my toast" way. Not in a way I even noticed until tonight. It's just, every day, I think I believe a little less and a little less and a little less. And that sucks. What do I do about that, Scherbatsky? You're Ted Mosby. You start believing again. In what, destiny? Chemistry. If you have chemistry, you only need one other thing. What's that? Timing. But timing's a bitch. Hey, we still have our 40 deal, right? If we're both still single at 40 I'm all yours. Hmm Unrelated, do architects make big money? Aggressively medium money. Damn it. Schmosby, you're up in two minutes. Okay, promise me two things, one) you start believing again, and two) don't cry during the toast, Schmosby. I promise. Good. We're having a baby. What, for real? For real. Oh! Oh! Attention, everyone! It's time for the reason we're all here tonight. Schmosby's toast! We're here tonight to celebrate love. Love brings us new life Hey! This isn't a meltdown. These are tears of joy. Ted is happy for his friends 'cause he's the best guy that I know. And do you know why he's happy? Because this beautiful lady right here is pregnant. How did you know that?! That was supposed to be a secret! Turns out Go Browns! Go Browns! Whoo! In AFC regular season play, but if they mean the Super Bowl, go Vikings. How dare you. That's my daughter, you piece of garbage. You're still gonna pay for all this, right? "Piece of garbage"? That's my son. And that is how Marshall destroyed Punchy's wedding. But we didn't care. There was gonna be a sixth member of our little family. No wedding will ever, ever be as bad as that one, right? I picked the right tie, didn't I? You nailed it. And hey, just be glad it's not the ducky tie. Ooh, the ducky tie. That's a good story kids. I'll get to that. Man, we are not even close to the end. You're a good best man, Ted. You're gonna cry during the toast, aren't you? Oh, I'm totally gonna cry. Come in. Ted, the bride wants to see you. Okay. Really? You're gonna go with that tie? Did I really ruin a wedding? No, you didn't ruin a wedding. Just the reception. And the bar mitzvah next door. And my dress. And your dress. You put on a dress at one point. Okay, you know what, that's it. I'm about to be a dad, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can look up to. So, sweeping declaration-- I am never getting drunk again as long as I live. I'm serious. Kids, it's not that your Uncle Marshall had a drinking problem. But whenever he made a sweeping declaration like that, you pretty much knew I did it again. But I'm getting ahead of myself. What happened to your leg? Oh, nothing. I'm meeting Nora for coffee. She's still mad at me, so I need some sympathy points. She likes musicals, so I'm going to tell her I fell off the stage during a performance of Man of La Mancha. What do you think? Lose the cast. A one-man show-- I like it! Just so we're clear-- this woman is mad at you because you lied to her. So your solution is to pretend you broke your leg? You're right. A neck brace. Thanks, Lil. Man, I wish I'd have talked to you sooner. I've been practicing with these crutches all day and whoever left them in my lobby probably really needs 'em. Well, uh, I have some good news. As you all know, I recently decided to get back out there and start dating again. And, uh, well Is this you? Uh, yeah. Hi. I'm Ted. That's great, Ted. Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment of pure destiny. The kind you just can't manufacture. Or so I thought. Oh, no. How did I get on there? Hi. Ted Mosby. Guilty. Hi. Ted Mosby. That is embarrassing. I should be on the cover of Egg On My Face magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of this one. Hi. Ted Mosby. in one day, and of those 16, ten were single. Of those ten, seven liked what they saw. Of those seven, four were women. Of those four, two gave me their real number. And I have a date with both of them. Okay. Guys, it's Garrison Cootes. Kids, Garrison Cootes was a senior partner at Honeywell &amp; Cootes. One of the biggest environmental law firms in America. Marshall would have given anything to work there. If I don't get this job, I might end up working at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere. And nobody wants that. Or maybe you guys want that, because you'll get free tacos, 'cause your my peeps. But right now I need all of you to calm down! Hello. Marshall, this is Garrison Cootes. Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, but I've just been swamped. Which is funny, 'cause I'm literally standing in a swamp. Anyway, I'm just out here, I'm just collecting some samples for this pollution case we're working on. I love the work you guys do. That's a croc No, I mean it. No, no, there's a crocodile about five feet away from me. So I'm just going to ignore the hot urine filling my waders as we speak, and tell you that we're very interested. He's interested. Obviously we have to do some sort of credit check, you know, a criminal record and Google search, but as long as nothing unseemly turns up, you're good to go, man. That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes! Well, I gotta run. This is so funny, because, actually, I physically have to run now. How I Met Your Mother 7x02 ♪ The Naked Truth Original Air Date on September 19, 2011 The next night, Barney met Nora for coffee. Thankfully, without the ridiculous leg cast. Hey, Nora, thanks for meeting me here. What happened to your neck? My wha? Oh, it's nothing. I was performing in a one-man show of Fiddler. There was this roof. Wow, that one has fantastic ta-tas. What, where? Oh Oh, damn it. Ta-ta. Wait, Nora, wait No, look, please don't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What is the matter with you? What kind of person needs to lie like that. A person who really, really likes you. And suspects, probably accurately, that you're way out of his league, and so he feels the need to I'm sorry, you were kidding about the fantastic ta-tas, right? 'Cause I'm looking around and I do not see 'em I just had two back-to-back dates. That's right, two lovely ladies, four large cappuccinos, and one sec. And I don't know which date was more awesome. Let's meet the girls. Jessica is a Rhodes scholar. She's traveled all over the world. Speaks four languages, is a concert pianist. And Claire reached for the check. So I don't know. It's a squeaker. I mean, both of these girls have the potential to be something really special. They both move on to the next round. Wait a minute. You're going to date two girls at once? Don't you think you should just choose one before it gets serious? Define serious. Well, that's complicated. I guess you have to weigh expectations, emotional investments Third base. Seriously, third base. So I can go to second base with both of these girls, no problem? Oh, honk away, my friend. Yeah, honk away. Oh, no. Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned the background check, Marshall had been scouring the Internet. Most of what he found was pretty harmless. In some cases, really awesome, until Not good. This-- this is not good. Thanks, Stacy. Wesleyan has a new cafeteria, thanks to the generous endowment from-- Oh, ho-ho! Did somebody say generous endowment? I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you can call me Beercules! Well, that could be anybody. Oh, man, I forgot about Beercules. Who made this Web site anyway? - Pete Durkenson. Is that the guy who convinced you to run across campus naked? I was pledging his frat, which I gave up on after three days, because frats are stupid and elitist and also I found out he wasn't in a frat. Oh, my God. This is awesome. I just got invited to the Architects' Ball, the annual gala that honors the city's greatest architects. Oh, no, you guys see why this sucks, right? Because it's an annual gala honoring the city's greatest architects? Robin, this is the social event of the year. You take a girl to the Architects' Ball, brother, you're going to third base. Whichever girl I take as my date, she will be Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend by the end of the night. Okay, no more sitting on the fence. Robin, get me my legal pad. It's pros and cons time! And kids, they really cheered. Let me make one thing very clear to you. I don't date guys who lie to me. Well, see, I did not know that. My bad. So, from here on in, no more lies. I will never lie to you again. I'm serious. Ask me anything. Okay. Have you ever successfully gotten a woman in bed by lying to her? Have I ever If I'm being totally honest Yes. More than once? More than once Wow, that's I guess if we're splitting hairs, then, technically there was a plurality to the times I've lied to women for sex having purposes. What were they? Nines and tens mostly. There was a four once. She was a slump buster. But, Nora, after that, I had a run that you would not believe. Man, honesty feels good. What were the lies? You want me to tell you every lie I've ever told a woman to get her into bed? A bed or any other place you had sex with her. Oh, you're good. Pete, Pete. Hey. Beercules! Bring it in, dude. Hey, I've been trying to call you, like, all night. Oh, my God, sorry. I would have answered, but it is Tuesday night. It's Sunday. And you know what that means. "Edward Forty Hands. " Kids, "Edward Forty Hands" is a game that involves taping two 40-ounce bottles of malt liquor to your hands. The object is to finish both bottle-- Oh, my God, why am I telling you this? Let's move on. Okay, you know that old video of me streaking? I watch it every day. Well, I need you to take it down off the Internet. Like, right now. There are two ways that can happen. One, you can give me $4 million, or you can help me go to the bathroom, because I I can't Yeah, those are two non-negotiable no's. Well, I'm sorry we could not do business together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of a game of "Edward Forty Hands," and the competition is fierce. Who are you playing with, anyway? Just myself. Meanwhile, Barney continued listing every lie he'd ever told to get laid. There's no time to explain how I got bit there. I just need someone to suck the poison out. The surgeons gave me a new face, honey. Aren't you relieved I'm alive? Me llamo David Beckham. If I were only casting The White Swan the role would be yours. No, I am a lesbian. This thing that I'm wearing is just really lifelike. Okay, let's skip ahead. What's the worst one? The lowest of the low? The creme de la creepy? Uh Oh, I once pulled The Soul Man. There was this beautiful girl who only dated black guys Barnell! Ooh, I knew it! I can't decide. They're both awesome. If only architects had two balls, right, Ted? I got this. Ted, left or right? Yes, yes, great idea. Let the fates decide, huh? I will pick left. Just call one of 'em. Ugh! Ted, deep in your heart, you know that you kind of like one more than the other. Trust me-- take the other. Um, maybe I haven't this is the Architects' Ball, Robin. It's a star-studded event. Okay, name one celebrity who's gonna be there. Uh Lenny Kravitz. Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there? Yeah. He's there every year. And that guy's a rock star. You know, Ted, I've been thinking-- it's too soon to narrow it down between these two girls. Just take a friend. Like I I don't know, maybe, uh, a friend who had a poster of Lenny Kravitz on her wall, and may or may not have, perhaps, dated that poster, on and off, throughout high school. This pros and cons list isn't cutting it. I need a color chart. Color chart! Color chart! And, kids, we all really chanted. Pete, please. I'm unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. I have a baby on the way. And now, I'm about to lose a job I really need because of a 15-year-old prank! Ugh! Do you hear yourself? Beercules, what happened? You're like a different person. The guy in that video was awesome. He had potential. He could have been president of the frat one day. There was no frat! Now he's just a bummer. It's not like I want to be a bummer. I just I have to be. I'm gonna be a dad. You'll have kids someday. You'll understand. Dude, I have four kids. Pete, please take the video down. All right, Beercules, I'll take the video down. If you can best me in a game of my own choosing. Oh, no And I select the beautiful game, the sweet science Pete, please, I'm so hungover the sport of kings I don't want to play "Edward Forty Hands. " I was gonna say darts-- but "Edward Forty Hands" it is! And that concludes all the space-related lies. Let's move on to the world of sports. Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought of another space one. "I've been bitten by a moon snake. 00, which means I have just about enough time to sit in a shower for 11 hours, hugging myself. So this was fun. Can I call you, or? Barney, you're funny, handsome and really quite clever. But you're also a sociopath. Well, I count three pros and one con, so How do you still think you have a chance with me? Because you sat here all night. You could've left right away, but you didn't. Look, Nora, all those lies-- that's the old me. But I swear to you, I am trying to change. You make me want to change. How do I know that's not a lie? I'll prove it. I will prove how serious I am. I will not leave this diner until I get a second date with you. Good-bye, Barney. I'm not kidding. This is a 24-hour diner. I'll stay here forever, if I have to-- and I will! Just water for me. Thanks. Okay, so red indicates level of attractiveness, blue-- intellectual stimulation, green-- emotional connection, yellow-- compatibility of life goals, and purple-- whether or not she reached for the check. Well, it looks like Jessica's ahead in the first four categories. Did not reach for the check Oh, this? No big deal. This This cost three months rent, and, uh, I've never gotten to wear it, because I bought it for that big event that you invited me to, which then fell through. But, you know what? Don't feel guilty about that. What big event? That thing with your uncle. His funeral? It didn't fall through, he miraculously came out of a coma. And I forgive you. Now, can I please meet Lenny Kravitz? I did it again! Aw, honey. You got drunk again. I can't believe I took the over. Just to be clear, "I did it again" is not a reference to my current state of inebriation. What's it a reference to? My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 years old. And if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, is watching this bow down to Beercules! Well, that could be anybody. Oh, goodness. Pete, this is Lily Aldrin. You're gonna take down that video of Marshall. You know why? Because I'm friends with three girls who dated you in college, and girls tell each other everything. Every tiny detail. Huh. So tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes the little wee-wee clock. Pete's got a little wee-wee? No idea. What's everyone getting? This was bound to happen eventually. I've been trying so hard to suppress, like, my carefree idiot side, that it just rebelled and came out swingin'! It sure did. Look at me! I'm a windmill! Who am I kidding? I'm not ready to be a dad. I thought that I was, but it's, like my dad never did stuff like that, you know? So what if he did? You'd still love him. And be honest-- wouldn't you love to stumble onto a video of him running down the street naked, yelling, "Hey, Marshall, look at me! I got an icicle on my deal!" Oh! Hey, guys! Ow! My neck! Uh oh! Hey! Look at that. Barney, what are you doing here? Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave until she gave me a second date, and I mean it. I've already been here nine hours. I still need another minute. I mean call me crazy, but I'm gonna stay here until I get that girl back. That-- that's what I want. The way Barney feels about Nora-- I want that feeling again. I don't want to be choosing between two girls, I want to be a complete head-over-heels idiot for one. Yeah, the complete head-over-heels idiot thing's pretty nice. It's not bad. Although, for the record-- sweeping declaration!-- I am never getting drunk again. And sure enough All hail Beercules! Yeah! But, again, I'm getting ahead of myself. Hello. Marshall! Garrison Cootes. Yes, Mr. Cootes. Hi. How are you? I just wanted to let you know, we did the background check, and that is some disturbing streaking. Sir, th-th-the thing is, um The rainbow streaking in this sample is definitely from chemical runoff. Oh, I Bottom line-- we'd love to have you on board. That is fantastic! Thank you, Mr. Cootes! Well, you're welcome. And-- oh, and when you're at the office, try to wear some clothes, okay, Beercules? Wow! That's a big snake. Oh, there's a snake in the swamp? No, I'm talking about your penis. See you tomorrow. I got the job. Yay! And I think that my boss already sexually harassed me. But he saw the video and he doesn't care! See that? Maybe Beercules isn't so bad after all. Yeah. Hello? Hey, Marshall, my name is Pete Durkenson. We went to Wesleyan together. Yeah, no, I know. Pete, we we just hung out yesterday. All right, now Lily's message makes a little more sense. Listen, don't worry, bro, I'm gonna take down the video. You know what? Leave it up. Whatever you say, Beercules. Scalpel. You know what? This is good. I want our kid to see every side of who I am. Yeah. Even the side that runs through the East Village hangin' brain. I'm gonna call Pete back. That's a good idea. That evening, I took Robin to the Architects' Ball.

Do you remember that night we found that crazy videotape of Barney? Game night. We played that ridiculous game Marshall invented. We've played it a few times since. I still don't get it. Remember the night we met? I remember you not letting me kiss you. Remember why? You had this ridiculous idea that the moment leading up to the kiss The drum roll. is as good as the kiss itself. Isn't it? Well, it's certainly more innocent. It's completely harmless. Completely. No, no-no-no-no-no. I let you come wash my dishes! I said my "oven" needed "cleaning"! I invited you into a porno! No. You were right. This is fate. I needed to see you one more time in order to know for sure about Klaus. And? And I have a bus to catch. Fine, you can see my boobs! To the alley! This seems unfair. I mean, I get that I'm the only person not allowed to see this, but it just, it-it seems unfair. Come on, Lily, hurry up. Guys You know, I'm all for honoring a bet, but who invited Takumi?

Why didn't I get on it with you? What would our lives be right now, if we had just held on? Would I have still run into you at this party tonight or would we have been there together? We'd go home to our home? You cook. I do the dishes. I'm happy that you're happy. But damn it. What if? Do you really want to know the answer to that? No. I think it would kill me. Good-bye, Ted.

I'm glad you guys can laugh, 'cause I think I'm gonna be physically ill. Coming down with a mallardy? Oh, they look hungry. There you go. Here you go. Kids, there was one part I left out. Good-bye, Ted. Okay, yes. What's the answer? There is a reason that it didn't work out between you and me, but it's not Germany. And I'm willing to bet it's the same reason none of your other relationships in the last six years have lasted either. It's Robin. No. Yes. She is so much bigger in your world than you realize. And this thing that you're all doing, you and Barney and Robin, where the three of you hang out at the bar night in, night out, like you're all just buddies? That doesn't work. Trust me.

Well, usually, I'm not the touchy-feely, talk-about-your-emotions type, but with this, I just had to be a big enough person to admit that I need help. Huh. I guess this is what growing up feels like. This is court-mandated therapy. You assaulted a woman. Oh  That silly thing. I guess we can talk about that. It all began a few months ago. There's this guy, Barney. We used to date. I set him up with this girl I work with, Nora. Barney was working hard to prove he was real boyfriend material. So, all week, I had to sit there watching him send flowers chocolates balloons. Then one day Hey I heard Barney didn't send anything today. Patrice said maybe he met somebody else. She's such a bitch, right? When a man loves a woman ♪ Can't keep his mind on nothin' else ♪ He's so dreamy. Nobody asked you, Patrice! I'm sorry. You must already think that I'm a horrible person. Robin, many of my patients are disturbed felons. Last week, one of them mailed me a bag of his feces. On the plus side, he remembered my birthday. You're doing fine.

I hate to play this card but if you don't come to this class I'm withholding sex. I don't think she's coming. Yeah. I was a little suspicious when she had us take separate cabs. Lily, don't do it! Just a little bit. Think about our baby! You got to be kidding me, Robin. Get to the assault. Okay, fine. So Barney and I were finishing packing his apartment Okay. One last item on the checklist. Disconnect the Cold Call 5000. What the hell's that? I was able to secure the customer database from a company that sells body glitter and high-end pasties. Hi, I know this is crazy, but I saw you on the subway, and I knew we were meant to be. If you believe in destiny, come to MacLaren's tonight and find me, Barney Stinson. Because I have this feeling that I'm supposed to be on you-- with you. Why not re-record it? I did like a hundred takes. It kept happening. I can't believe Lily's not coming! You know what? Screw it! Who says that two bros can't rock a birthing class? Rock it! Today, we'll be exploring "The Sensual Massage. " Let's start by gently cupping our partner's hands and just breathe each other in. Thanks, Robin. You're the only person I know who would help me do all that. You're a real bro. Am I, though? 'Cause I'm really more of a woman. To my femininity. Nah, you're more of a bro. You're a dude. You're a man. Hey, you are flying solo one more night. How about I put on a smokin' hot dress, you slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie and we paint the town? I mean, when was the last time we got rip-roaring drunk in clothing that highlights our genders? So, your plan was to be out on the town, dressed provocatively, drinking with another woman's man. Let me guess, you got drunk under your desk again? No, Mr. Harvard. I handled things a little differently  So, I suppose now you want me to talk about how it felt watching Barney and Nora walk off together, right? I'd rather just skip ahead to the assault. My next patient thinks he's God. On the off chance that he's right, I really don't want to keep him waiting. Well, right after they left, something crazy happened. Excuse me, do you know where I can find Barney Stinson? He saw me on the subway and left me a message to meet him here. Why not re-record it? I did like a hundred takes. It kept happening. Hi, I know this is crazy, but I saw you on the subway He asked me if I believed in destiny. And I do. We are so meant to be. Where can I find him? So I was faced with a moral dilemma. Unleash this nut bag on them or be a bigger person, and help my friend. Barney's at Café L'Amour, - Awesome! - No, wait, wait, wait! Okay, this isn't right. Let's pop that top button, show off your gals. Ooh! Good luck, go get 'em! Let your love come through your fingers. Dude, the rule is no moaning and keep your eyes open at all times. Stop being weird. And hey, when do I get to be the woman? Now remember, the most important thing in pregnancy is to keep Mom calm and happy. She knows best what she needs. Trust her. Now, Papas, I want you to take Mom's hands in yours, look deep into her eyes, and repeat after me. I believe in you. I believe in you. I honor your body's wisdom. I honor your body's wisdom. Your womb is a temple. The truth is, I thought I'd be married by now and going through all this stuff alongside you guys. But even if I meet the girl of my dreams right this second, I'm still one night and nine months away from having a family of my own. And that's assuming the mother of my children is just a huge slut. Don't lose hope, Ted. That slut is out there. Thanks, buddy. We owe Lily an apology. Yeah. Dads, this is the time that I'll answer every question you've ever had about vaginas. Damn it! Hey. I'm so sorry, Lily. You have just a little bit. I realize now that it's my job for the next seven months to keep you happy, and that's why I'm no longer withholding sex. My hero. But I want to make sure that you feel comfortable with Dr. Sonya, too. I do. And you know what, the fact that she's so calm and laid back, maybe that's not a bad thing. Maybe that's exactly what we're gonna want in that delivery room. That's a crazy story, kids. I'll get to that. Hey, Ted's out in the hall. He wants to apologize, too. Hey. What happened to your sock? Long story. Bottom line, I realized that sometimes love means taking a step back. Well, not always. I mean, sometimes it's better to interfere and sabotage stuff, right? Well, I think if you care about somebody, you should want them to be happy, even if you wind up being left out. Wow. The lesson you learned with Lily and Marshall is directly applicable to my situation, and is therefore a valid part of how I'll eventually tell this story. Really? That's how that went down? Point is, it all tied together, right? Not really at all. Barney, it's me! I love you, Barney! Mmm, scallops look good. Oh, they are. But the last time I was here they ran out, so, uh knock on wood. Well, I have my eye on the red velvet cake for dessert. Lovely. Splitsies? Nah, I want it all to myself. Really? Arm wrestle for it? No!  All right. I love this place. Babe. Barney doesn't know a thing about any of this. But that's why I got court-mandated therapy. You must think I'm nuts. I think you're a really good friend. Really? Really. As far as I'm concerned, there was no criminal intent to this assault. Well, thanks, Doc! Well, look at us! We got this wrapped up in one session. Go us, right? Now let's discuss how you keyed the judge's car. Okay. Marshall and Lily were supposed to go to the zoo-- okay, it all ties together, I swear. Now ♪ And against all logic, it was actually going well. But why? Why-why am I constantly looking for reasons not to be happy? Maybe because the idea of finally being happy terrifies you. Bro, you are killing it today. Pshh! We got something good here. We are totes gonna conquer my fear of abandonment! I can't see you anymore. Nice. "Oh, no! You're abandoning me!" Oh, no. You're abandoning me? I'm sorry. I'm moving to Alaska. And that might have been the end of it. But a week later Kevin?! What are you doing here? Okay, look, I lied to you about moving to Alaska. I-I had to stop seeing you. Why? 'Cause I think you're cute. And ethically, I can't be your therapist if I'm attracted to you. Oh, I get it. You dump me as a patient just so you can ask me out? I'm not gonna ask you out. You're not? No. We met in therapy. It's inappropriate for me to date a patient. Anyway, it was nice seeing you. Hey, wait. How do you define "date"? Two people having a meal together, sitting across the table making googly eyes at each other What about two people eating alone, sitting side by side, making googly eyes at the coffee maker? Okay, it's not a date. Exactly. Not a date. And so Robin and Kevin had breakfast alone, side by side every day that week. Until finally Oh, hey! Sorry. No cabs. Ran 40 blocks all the way here.

A little creepy, bro. Okay, it's not creepy. Ehhhh it's creepy. Who thinks it's creepy to date your therapist? - Pollstered. We're moving on! So, class, to your left, you will see some excellent examples of what we'd call windows. So where are we going now? I have no idea. This is a disaster. Some of them are already starting to go home.

Just give me one minute, Larry. Thank you. Our grotesque, inevitable doom! Now, of course, you can't go around telling all the people that the good ship Environmentalism has sailed off into the sunset. There would cause a panic.

I mean, that is, if becoming a deejay doesn't pan out. You are gonna be a great architect. He became a deejay. Robin, what are you doing here? I told you I can't be your therapist. I know. Today, I am your therapist. What? You said yourself, I'm always looking for reasons not to be happy. Well, I'm trying to change that.
